# HTML/CSS Revision

The revision week is for you to revise what you have already learned. If you do not understand any part of the module, go over it again and try to understand it better. Use this week to experiment. Search on Google to learn more about the topics. Practice using the code you have learned over and over again so that you can write it more quickly.

You can revise in any way you like. The following is a suggestion for the steps you can take.

1. Read over the syllabus for weeks 1, 2 and 3. For each topic, write down whether you understand it well, understand it ok, or don't understand it at all. Make a list of the topics you understand ok, or not at all.

1. For each topic in your list, look at the syllabus for that topic. If there are any links in that section to learn more, follow those links and read the material. At the bottom of each week's syllabus, you will find a list of Resources. Use those to revise any topics on your list.

1. If there are any topics you still do not understand well, search on Google to try to learn more. For example, if you don't understand CSS sibling selectors, try searching for "What are CSS sibling selectors", "When should I use CSS sibling selectors" and similar questions.

1. Use the [HTML/CSS Project](https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/html-css-project) you built to practice the topics we covered in this module. Look at other websites and try to recreate parts of other websites that you like.
