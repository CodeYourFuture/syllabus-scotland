It is the software which manages your computer's basic functions and provides you with a way to interact with it. Other operating systems you might have heard of are Microsoft Windows and Apple macOS. We use Ubuntu because it is particularly suited to the web development tasks we are doing, as most web sites run on a Linux-based computer. \nMost tasks work very similarly to other computer systems you might have used, but there is also the terminal which is a very powerful but different way of telling the computer what to do. We will introduce this in another session next week.\nLogging in\n\nThe first thing you'll need to do after turning on your laptop is to login. Your user name is coder and we have supplied you with a password. To log in click on coder in the middle of the screen, type in your password and then press either the Enter key or click Sign In.\nLaunching programs\nThere are two main ways to launch programs (also known as applications) on Ubuntu.\nLauncher\n\nThe first is to launch one of the pinned application at the side of the screen. To try this, launch the Firefox web browser by clicking on the Firefox icon in the top left-hand corner.\nActivities\n\nThe other way is to search for the application in the Activities Overview - you'll need to do this if the program isn't pinned. To do this either click the word Activities in the top left-hand corner of your screen or press the Windows key (the one with the flag next to Space). You can then type the name of the program to launch and you will get a selection to choose from. Type impress to find LibreOffice Impress, a program for making presentations, then click on it to start it.\nSwitching between programs\nThe easiest way to do this is with the launcher. Try clicking back and forth between Firefox and Impress.\nClosing programs\nTo close an application click the red X icon in the top right-hand corner of its window. If you have files open in an application you may be asked whether you wish to save them.\nWorking with files\nFor a graphical way to navigate your files, Ubuntu includes the Files application. This is the 2nd icon down in the top left-hand corner of the screen. Click it once to open the application.\nMost of the time we will be working with files using Visual Studio Code or the Terminal (next week) however depending on how comfortable you are you might also want to practice using the Files application as well - e.g. to open/delete/examine files.\n\nCreating a folder\nIt's very important to keep your files organised, otherwise it's easy to get confused or end up in the wrong place! To help with this we'll create a folder to store your work for CodeYourFuture.\nClick the Documents folder on the left-hand side of the window, or double-click on the Documents folder in the main body of the window. Once you are inside the Documents folder right-click and select Create New Folder. You'll then get a dialog like the one below. Type in the name CodeYourFuture and click Create. Then, you can close the window.\nTurning off your computer\n\nTo shutdown your computer you should always* use the shutdown button in the top right-hand corner of your screen, after closing your application.\nPlease do not hold the power button on the laptop to force it off as this can sometimes cause damage both to Ubuntu and your data, even if it appears to be fine. This option is only there as a last resort in case your computer isn't responding.\nConnecting to a wi-fi network\nIf you need to connect to a wi-fi network this will be listed on the same menu as the power button in the top right-hand corner. Most wi-fi networks will require a password.\nIntroduction to Slack\nSlack is a team communication tool that we will use to communicate with each other throughout the whole course.\nLet's go through some exercises to get acquainted with Slack.\nChannels\nTopics are organised in different channels.\n\nExercises\n\nFind the #scotland-fun-stuff channel. This is where we organise fun things!\nFind the #random channel. This is where we post random stuff!\n\nEmojis\nEmojis make it easy to engage with other people's comments without needing to write a reply.\n\nExercises\n\nA mentor will now post a message on Slack. Give it a thumbs up to show that you have read the message!\nA mentor will now post the name of food that they like. Give it a thumbs up if you like it or a thumbs down if you don't like it!\n\nThreads\nIf everyone replies in the channel then it can get very messy when there are multiple conversations happening at the same time.\nTo make conversations more organised, we write replies in threads.\nThis way, a single conversation stays in one thread.\nExercises\n\nA mentor will now post a message asking what your favourite food is. Reply in a thread with your favourite food!\nA mentor will now post a message asking what your favourite hobby is. Reply in a thread with your favourite hobby!\n\nFor bonus points, react with an emoji to your classmate's answers!\nTips for success\nDon't hide when you don't know.\n\nIt is normal not to know things as programmers\n\nThe volunteers can't help you if we don't know you are lost\n\nProbably someone else in the class has the same question as you, and is too scared to ask\n\nIf the teacher asks if everyone understands, SAY if you have doubts\n\n\nThe goal is NOT to complete the exercises. The goal is to learn.\nCompletion of all exercises is not success if you do not understand.\nIf you learn so that you can complete any future exercises without help (e.g. in a job interview), that is success.\nWhen getting help, stay in control (of the computer and the process)\nEach exercise is an opportunity to learn - don't let anyone steal that from you by solving your problem.\nAgain - completing the exercise is not the goal. The goal is for you to learn how to complete the exercise.\nIn group-work, seek to understand everything\nIf you've done something in group-work that you don't fully understand:\n\nSlow things down\n\nGet it explained\n\nGo back to it afterwards by yourself, and challenge yourself to understand it\n\n\nDon't let it go because the next time you don't understand something, it will be harder to get things explained.\nSo if you solve 10 exercises together in a group-work exercise, it is a great idea to go back over and try to solve them yourself the next day.\nTake notes about what you don't understand\nAt a minimum, take note of the exercise numbers that you have problems with, even if you solve them eventually. \nThen you should revisit them some time afterwards and complete them again from scratch until you're positive you understand.\nTry prediction, to get all the juice out of each exercise!\nWith simple programming challenges, it is easy to just repeatedly modify and re-run your program until it works, \nbut you won't learn much unless you are thinking (and this playful approach doesn't work with more complicated problems), so instead:\nAlways try to predict what your code will do before you run it.\nWrite your prediction down, or tell your a friend - you can make it a game. After you run the program, if your guess was wrong, discuss why, then FIND OUT why.\nDon't be frustrated when a volunteer does not solve your problem for you\nThe instructors have told them not to! Can you say why?\nThis is a place where we help each other\nThis is not a competition. There are no prizes for solving the problem first.\nIf you can help your fellow students learn, then they will be in a better position to help you later, \nand you will be much happier when you're working with them on group projects.\nRemember though: it is much more important that people understand than that they finish the exercise! Don't solve their problems for them!\nIf you're stuck\n\nDon't give up! There is a solution that works that you haven't tried yet.\nIt is always okay to ask Google.\nIf you've been stuck for more than five minutes in class or ten minutes at home, ask on Slack.\nAsk students for help before you ask mentors. Explaining how things work helps both the person explaining and the person being explained to.\n\nIntroduction to programming\nComputer programs are like recipes\nA computer program is a sequence of instructions given to a computer that describe how the computer should carry out a task.\nThis is a bit like a recipe.\nHere is a recipe to boil an egg.\n\nFill a pan with water\nBring the water to a boil\nPrick a hole in the egg\nPut the egg in the water with a spoon\nWait six minutes\nTake the egg out of the water\n\nIf you are cooking, and you are reading a recipe that has a step missing, you can probably understand where\nthe recipe is wrong and what you will have to add to make things work.\n\nFill a pan with water\nPrick a hole in the egg\nPut the egg in the water with a spoon\nWait six minutes\nTake the egg out of the water\n\nWhat's missing here?\nComputers are very fast, but they are not very clever. You can tell when you have been given the wrong instructions.\nA computer cannot. They will do exactly what you tell them to do, even if it doesn't make any sense.\nSo we need to be very precise and make sure all the steps we give the computer are correct and none of them are missing.\nGroup exercise - robot following a path\nOrder matters - sometimes\nTurn left then move forward does not do the same thing as move forward followed by turn left.\nTurn left then turn right does the same thing as turn right followed by turn left.\nGoing back to our recipe:\n\nFill a pan with water\nBring the water to a boil\nPrick a hole in the egg\nPut the egg in the water with a spoon\nWait six minutes\nTake the egg out of the water\n\nIs this the only order of instructions that works? Are any other orders possible?\nCode.org exercises\nWe will register on Code.org and complete a few exercises together.\nOnce you've registered, please go to https://studio.code.org/s/course3/stage/2/puzzle/1 and complete puzzles 1, 2 and 3.\nRepeating commands\nMove forward. Move forward. Move forward.\nImagine if you had to give your friends directions to your house one step at a time.\nIt would take longer to write the instructions than it would take for them to get there!\nLuckily even computers don't need to be given directions one step at a time. We can tell them to repeat commands.\nRepeat ten times: move forward is much easier to say - or type - than move forward ten times.\nGroup exercise - robot following a path with repeated commands\nCode.org exercises\nPlease go to https://studio.code.org/s/course3/stage/2/puzzle/4 and complete puzzles 4 and 5.\nRepeating blocks of commands\nWe can also give the computer a list of more than one instruction, and tell it how many times to repeat that list.\nRepeating one instruction is just a special case of repeating a list of instructions - we are repeating a list which is\njust one instruction long.\nThis is extremely useful and extremely powerful. If we give a robot all the instructions it needs to make a paper plane,\nwe can then just tell it to repeat that list ten times and we have ten paper planes.\nThere are many ways to repeat a list of instructions, but we describe any sort of repetition of an instruction list\nas a loop, and we would call the instruction list itself a loop body.\nGroup exercise - robot going round a square\nCode.org exercises\nPlease go to https://studio.code.org/s/course3/stage/2/puzzle/4 and complete puzzles 6, 7 and 8.\nThe puzzles are getting more difficult now. If you have any problems, put a question on Slack and see if anyone\nelse can help! If you finish quickly, look at the channel and see if there are any questions you can answer.\nRepeat until\nWhen we're giving people directions, we don't say \"drive 154 metres west, then 122 metres southwest, then 20 metres north.\"\nOften we don't know precisely how far it is from one place to another. The same is true when we're giving computers\ninstructions.\nWe can tell the computer to keep repeating the list of instructions until something happens, just like\nwe would tell our friends to drive until they are past the supermarket and then turn left.\nGroup exercise - robot going round a square until it gets back to the start\nCode.org exercises\nPlease go to https://studio.code.org/s/course3/stage/2/puzzle/4 and complete puzzles 9, 10, 11, 12 and 13.\nFunctions\nSometimes we want to do the same thing many times, but in different places. Repeat doesn't help, because\nwe want to do other things in between repeating the instruction list.\nWe can create something called a function. Functions are reusable blocks of instructions that can be called any time,\ninside a loop or outside.\nWhat does that mean? How is it useful?\nGoing back to the recipe for boiling an egg:\n\nFill a pan with water\nBring the water to a boil\nPrick a hole in the egg\nPut the egg in the water with a spoon\nWait six minutes\nTake the egg out of the water\n\nThis is not detailed enough to give to a computer. In general, computers need more instructions than we do.\nWe can write in a recipe for humans to follow, \"fill a pan with water\", but a computer would need to be told what that means.\nHere is a recipe for filling a pan with water:\n\nPut the pan under a tap\nTurn the tap on\nWait until the pan is full\nTurn the tap off\n\nWe can supply the computer a list of instructions, and tell it what that list is called. In this case, we would call our\nfunction a name like FillPanWithWater. We can then use FillPanWithWater as a new word in the language we talk to\nthe computer with.\nGroup exercise - robot that can't turn left\nCode.org exercises\nPlease go to https://studio.code.org/s/course3/stage/6/puzzle/1 and complete as many puzzles as you can.\nHomework for next week\n\nComplete the rest of the stage 6 exercises on Code.org.\nSee if you can do the first four debugging exercises at https://studio.code.org/s/course3/stage/14/puzzle/1.\nWatch the videos at https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeY8Jv3ftRaj5yJdEdo03vzuAEQil4XdC.\n\n"},"introduction/week-2/lesson.html":{"url":"introduction/week-2/lesson.html","title":"Week 0.2 - Introduction","keywords":"","body":"Week 0.2\nIntroduction to the terminal\n\nDuring your course journey and onwards, the terminal (also known as command line) will be one of your most valuable tools.\nIt will help you to interact with your computer faster, by helping you to:\n\nCreate and delete files\nInstall web development tools\nUse source control (explained in the next lesson)\nStart a server\n\nThere are many, many other things you can do with the terminal and it's probably the most powerful way of working with your computer, however those above are the ones on which we'll focus.\nAlthough we're learning on Linux most of this will also be useful on an Apple Mac or on the Windows 10 Subsystem for Linux.\nWe would like you to go through this tutorial on the Ubuntu web site:\n\nUbuntu tutorials - the Linux command line for beginners\n\nThe parts we want you to work through are 1, 3, 4 (stop at redirection) and 5 however there is a lot of useful material in all of the sections.\nPart 2 is not needed for the course, but it would be worth having a look at if you're interested to learn more of the history of Linux and Ubuntu.\nYou should add the above link to your browser bookmarks since you'll probably want to refer to it in future. \nCommand reference\nThis is a quick reference for some of the commands covered in the tutorial above.\n\ncd - change directory. To move up into the parent directory use: cd ..\nls - list the contents of a directory.\nCan also be used as ls [directory_name] to list the contents of a specific directory without actually moving (with cd) to it\npwd - print the full location of your current directory\nmkdir [name] - create a new directory, with the given name after a space\ntouch [file_name] - create a new file, with the given name (don't forget to add the extension, like .css or .html)\nrm [file_name] - remove a file\nrm -r [directory_name] - remove a directory (and all files inside that directory)\n\nIntroduction to VS Code\nVS Code is the application we will use to write code.\nFile tree view\nVS Code has an Explorer sidebar on the left side which displays files in a tree view.\nCreating, renaming and moving files can be done directly in VS Code.\n\nFinding files\nWhen working with big projects, you will often need to find a file quickly, without having to go through the tree view manually.\nThe keyboard shortcut to do this is: Ctrl + P (or Cmd + P on Mac)\n\nAuto-complete\nVS Code has auto-completion, which gives you suggestions of what you can can write next when you type something.\nFor example, when writing a CSS property, it will tell you what values you can assign it to:\n\nSpell-checking\nIt can be easy to make spelling mistakes when coding, however VS Code does not have in-built spell-checking.\nLet's install a spell checker extension which will help reduce the number of errors made coding.\nGit\n&#x1F469;‍&#x1F3EB; Reading this in the class?

When your phone battery is low, your phone can decide to pop up a message and tell you to plug it in.\nIf you type a word wrongly when you're writing an email, the spell-checker can decide to draw a squiggly line under it. This is just the tip of\nthe iceberg: our phones and computers are making decisions all the time, thousands of times a second.\nWhen we write computer programs, we can tell the computer to make decisions too.\nThe word we need is: if.\nIt works the same way we would use it in conversation if we were telling someone to do something.\n\"Go to the shops and get a litre of milk. If eggs are half price then buy six.\"\ngo to the shops\nget a litre of milk\nif eggs are half price\nthen buy six\nThere are two different possible outcomes.\nIf eggs are half price, we will buy six. If eggs are not half price, we will not buy any.\nWe call this a conditional. If the condition is met we do something. If it is not met, we don't.\nWhat do we mean by condition?\nA condition is something that can be either true or false. It's something the computer has to check in order to make the decision.\nWhich of these things are conditions? (Hint: try to think if it is possible for the sentence to be true or false).\n\n\"It is raining.\"\n\"Water the plants.\"\n\"My name is Inigo Montoya.\"\n\"Wake the mentors up.\"\n\"The mentors are awake.\"\n\nCode.org exercises\nPlease go to https://studio.code.org/s/course3/stage/7/puzzle/1 and do puzzles 1 to 3.\nElse\nSometimes we want to choose between two different courses of action: we do one thing when the condition is true, and\nanother thing when the condition is false.\nTo return to the eggs example:\nif eggs are half price\n    buy twelve eggs\nelse\n    buy six eggs\nThis is the same as:\nif eggs are half price\n    buy twelve eggs\nif eggs are not half price\n    buy six eggs\nIt is not the same as:\nif eggs are half price\n    buy twelve eggs\n\nbuy six eggs\nWhat is the difference?\nCode.org exercises\nPlease go to https://studio.code.org/s/course3/stage/7/puzzle/1 and do puzzles 4 to 8.\nWhile loops\nUp until now we've used repeat until.\nThere is no repeat until command in JavaScript. Instead we have while.\nWhile is like repeat until but the condition is the other way around.\nInstead of stopping when something is true, we stop when something is not true.\nThis makes while similar to if: if the condition is true, then we\nwill carry out the block of commands attached to the if or while, and if\nit is not true, we don't.\nCode.org exercises\nPlease go to https://studio.code.org/s/course3/stage/12/puzzle/1 and do puzzles 1 to 9.\nSolving problems with code\nOne of the most important skills to learn as a programmer is to identify when solving\na problem requires either making a decision or doing the same thing repeatedly.\nHere are some problems to solve - do they require a loop, a conditional, or both?\n\nPrinting all the words in the dictionary starting with the letter K\nMultiplying all the numbers from 1 to 10 together\nChecking if the key the user just pressed was \"space\"\nAdding up the prices of all the items in an online shopping basket\nReplacing all the occurrences of \"teh\" in a document with \"the\"\nFinding out if anyone in the class has a sister who speaks Japanese\n\nHomework\n\nDo the nested loop exercises starting at https://studio.code.org/s/course3/stage/13/puzzle/1.\nDo the rest of the debugging exercises starting at https://studio.code.org/s/course3/stage/14/puzzle/5.\n\n"},"introduction/week-2/git-workshop-transcript.html":{"url":"introduction/week-2/git-workshop-transcript.html","title":"Git workshop","keywords":"","body":"Introduction to Git\nLet's say you're working on an application for a job. You're inside a folder..\n\nAnd create some new files for my CV and cover letter:\n\nYou add some starting text to both files:\n\nThis is your blank canvas. You are ready to start writing!\nYou make a lot of changes to both files. You now have a full cover letter, a full CV, with experience, education etc. But you realise:\n\nyou have lost your starting \"template\", that had a blank CV and cover letter. If you wanted to apply for a new job you would have to re-create the folder again and prepare both files again\nif you make some changes to your CV, save them, turn off your computer, and the next day you realise you don't need them anymore, it will be really hard to undo them. You need to remember exactly what you changed, and only remove those changes.\n\nWhat we really want is to save occasional \"snapshots\". As we're working through our job application, we want to take a \"photo\" of our folder each time we make an important change, so we can go back to it if we need to.\nSo let's say our next task is to add a \"Skills\" section to our CV. We'll start by adding some skills, maybe decide to remove some, then add some more skills again, but once we're done and satisfied that we completed the task, we'll commit to being definitely done (which means we can \"take a snapshot\" of our folder).\n\nFirst word of the day:\ncommit\n\nSo let's do that (go here to play the video from the beginning):\n\nAs you can see, each time we commit to finishing a task, we create a new folder, give it the name of our task (so we can find it easier), and copy all our files in it.\nWe now have these folders:\n\nThe selected one, job-application, is our latest one. It is the one that has all the latest changes and is the most up to date. The other ones, contain different milestones of our work, and they're named accordingly! There's a folder for our initial template (right before we first started writing) another one for when we added \"Education\" to our CV etc.\nNow let's say that while working on our job application, we get a message about an even better job! So we pause our current work, and open our initial-job-application folder so we can adapt our CV and cover letter for the new job.\nOr let's say we send our CV to a friend to review. They tell us they like everything, except the \"Skills\" section. So we open up the folder right before we added the skills, copy the files in there to our job-application folder and start again.\nSnapshots are really powerful! They're like a time machine! The names you give to your folders are also kind of important! (they help you know what is what)\n\nBut each time we finished a task, we've been copying ALL of the files to the new folder. What if we're not ready to copy all files? What if we've added a \"References\" section in our CV, and it looks good, and we also changed the cover letter a bit - but we're not quite ready to commit the cover letter.\nWell, we can add only the files we want to our commit. We'll copy just the CV to the new folder, and instead of copying the latest version of the cover letter, we'll just get it from the previous folder we committed.\n\nOur second important word:\nadd\n\n\nThis is all really useful! But a bit annoying to do each time! And we're going to make a lot more changes - which means A LOT more folders. It will get confusing really fast.\nWould it not be nice if we had a robot we could ask to do all this work for us? We would just tell it anytime we're ready to commit, and it would create those folders for us, somewhere hidden, where we can't see them! Something like Alexa, or Siri - \"hey Alexa, add these files, I'm ready to commit them!\"\nTurns out we do, but our robot is called Git. And whenever we want to use Git in a folder, to track our changes, we need to first tell it to initialize in that folder.\n\nSo our third important word is:\ninit\n\nTo put it all together, the way we'd talk to Git is:\ngit init\ngit add CV.txt\ngit commit -m \"add skills\"\nNow it's your turn:\n\nCreate a new folder with mkdir\ncd to that folder\nrun git init\ncreate a simple CV file\nadd it to be committed\ncommit it with a message\ncreate a cover letter file\nadd it to be committed\ncommit it with a message\nnow make some changes to both files\nadd both files to be committed\ncommit your change with a message\n\n\nRemember how we created all those directories? They don't seem to appear here, where is git storing them? Well, when you run git init, Git actually created a hidden folder and puts all your snapshots in there.\nSo how can we see what we committed if it's all hidden away? Try:\ngit log\nYou'll see the list of your commits, in the order you made them!\nHow about if you make changes to some files, you're ready to commit, but you forgot which ones you changed. How do you add them? Try:\ngit status\nYou'll see a list of files. Their colour is important:\n RED  --> they've been changed, but are not added yet, so will not be part of the next commit\n GREEN  --> they've been changed AND added to be part of the next commit\nSo let's practice:\n\nMake some changes to your CV\nuse git status and see what appears (notice the red file)\nadd the CV to be part of the next commit\nuse git status again (notice how it's now green)\ncommit it with a message\nuse git status (there should be no files now)\nchange CV again\nadd it to be part of the next commit\nnow change the Cover Letter\nuse git status (notice how one is green and one is red)\ncommit with a message\nuse git status (notice how there's only the red Cover Letter now)\nadd the Cover Letter and commit\nuse git status (notice how you have no files)\nuse git log to see what changes you made\n\n\nFinally, let's share our work with our friends! We'll use GitHub for this.\n\nGo to https://github.com and create a new account\nCreate a new repository\n\n\n\nCopy the commands it gives you and run them in the terminal\n\n\n\nrun git push\n\n\nAnd that is the last important word we'll learn today:\npush\n\n\n\nLast Git exercise:\nSpend 5 minutes to write down what you learned about Git. Use your own words, don't copy/paste the lesson.\n\n"},"html-css/":{"url":"html-css/","title":"HTML/CSS","keywords":"","body":"HTML & CSS\n\n\n\nWeeks\nContent\n\n\n\n\nweek-01\nSemantic HTML tags .

If you want to refresh your memory, read this quick guide to the HTML syntax.\nAll together, let's review the basic syntax in the following example:\n\n    Learning HTML\n    Get to know the HTML basics.\n    Read Article\n\n\n\nExercise: Which parts are the Tags and which parts are the Attributes.\n\nHTML tags are arranged in a hierarchy. This is sometimes called \"nesting\" tags or creating an HTML \"tree\". Between the opening  tag and the closing  tag there are three other tags. We call these \"child\" tags, because they have a parent-child relationship.\n\n\nExercise: As a group, let's try to name all of the parent and child tags in the following example.\n\n\n    Learning HTML\n    \n        Author:\n        Code Your Future\n    \n    Get to know the HTML basics.\n    Read Article\n\n\nBegin Individual Exercises\nDuring this module, you will use an exercise project to practice what you learn. To begin, open the repository, scroll down and follow the instructions in the image below.\n\nFor now, stop after you complete exercises 1 and 2.\nSemantic HTML\nWhen writing HTML code, you can use different tags to describe the content. Is it a navigation menu, a paragraph of text, or an article? By using the correct tag, you help search engines like Google or screen readers for the visually impaired.\n\nSemantic HTML is the use of HTML markup to reinforce the semantics, or meaning, of the information in webpages and web applications rather than merely to define its presentation or look. Wikipedia\n\nWe'll cover the following semantic tags and talk about their use on the BBC News website:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are more than 100 semantic tags. If you would like, you can review several semantic tags.\n\nGroup Discussion: How does semantic HTML relate to the Separation of Concerns that we discussed at the start of the class?\n\nAdd CSS and JavaScript\nDuring your application process, you wrote CSS code. Later in this course you will learn about JavaScript. Both are different languages from HTML.\nA typical webpage will require three files, one for each language:\n\nindex.html\nstyles.css\nmain.js\n\nTo use all of the files together, we have to tell the HTML code to load the other two files. Use the  tag to add the CSS file and the  tag to add the JavaScript:\n\n  \n    Example Webpage\n    \n  \n  \n    My webpage content.\n    \n  \n\n\nThe  tag must be placed in the  element. Usually, the  tag appears near the end of the  element of the HTML page:\n\nGroup Discussion: How do these files relate to the Separation of Concerns that we discussed at the start of the class?\n\nFile Paths\nThe HTML file isn't always in the same directory as the CSS and JavaScript files. It is common for them to appear in an assets directory.\n\nIn the example above, the  would have to be:\n\n\n\nWant to learn more?

Let's review the most common selectors.\n\n\n\n\nYou can review the most Common Selectors.\n\nCSS Properties\nCSS properties allow you to change the way an element appears on your HTML page. You do this by assigning values to properties. Consider the properties and values in CSS code below.\np {\n  color: darkslategrey;\n  font-size: 16px;\n  line-height: 1.8em;\n}\n\n\nGroup Exercise: Think of a chair. It might be green or red, tall or short. As a group, brainstorm as many properties and values as you can imagine for a chair.\n\nBox Model\nIn CSS, every element is a box. An image is a box. A link is a box. The area around this box can be modified with properties that we call margins, borders and padding.

To ensure we're presenting a website that's easy to use on any device, we use Responsive Web Design techniques to modify how content is displayed depending on the viewport.\n\nExercise: As a group, let's brainstorm as many devices as we can think of which might access the websites we build.\n\nSee how much variety there is in viewport sizes.\nMedia Queries\nAs you learned in your homework assignment, media queries help us change the display of our content depending on the size of the viewport. Let's review what you learned and break down a media query:\n@media screen and (min-width: 900px) {\n  body {\n    background: red;\n  }\n}\n\nIn this media query, we're assigning a red background color to the  element whenever the viewport is larger than 900px, and we're viewing on a screen.\n\n@media starts the media query\nscreen tells it to apply these styles to screen displays. Other displays\nmight be print, for when a webpage is being printed.\n(min-width: 900px) tells it to apply these styles when the viewport is\nlarger than 900px\n\nFinally, we wrap all of our styles for this media query in the brackets { and }, just like a CSS rule.\nComplete exercise 10 from the exercise project.\nFlexbox\nFlexbox allows you to arrange things on a webpage. These can be buttons,  elements, paragraphs, anything you want!\nTo add flexbox:\n\nIdentify the elements you want to arrange in a certain way. Let's use this for now:\n\n  Home\n  Gallery\n  Contact\n\n\nMake sure they're part of the same container:\n\n  \n    Home\n    Gallery\n    Contact\n  \n\n\nTell the container to use Flexbox to arrange all its children\n\n.menu {\n  display: flex;\n}\n\nOnce you have flexbox applied to the container you can start adding more rules to tell it exactly how the elements should be arranged.\nflex-direction\nDisplay elements in a row\n.menu {\n  display: flex;\n  flex-direction: row;\n}\n\n\nDisplay elements in a column\n.menu {\n  display: flex;\n  flex-direction: column;\n}\n\n\njustify-content\nSpace out elements equally in a row\n.menu {\n  display: flex;\n  flex-direction: row;\n  justify-content: space-between; /* OR space-around */\n}\n\n\nSpace out elements equally in a column\n.menu {\n  display: flex;\n  flex-direction: column;\n  justify-content: space-between; /* OR space-around */\n}\n\n\n\nImportant: In the above 2 examples we used the same rule (justify-content: space-between;), but we changed the flex-direction from row to column. Notice how justify-content works in the same direction as flex-direction. In the images above, the \"green\" arrow for justify-content is operating in the same direction as flex-direction.\n\nalign-items\nAlign elements in a row\n.menu {\n  display: flex;\n  flex-direction: row;\n  align-items: center;\n}\n\n\nAlign elements on a column\n.menu {\n  display: flex;\n  flex-direction: column;\n  align-items: center;\n}\n\n\n\nImportant: While justify-content works in the same direction as flex-direction, align-items works the opposite way! Have a close look at the above images - the \"green\" arrow is opposite to the yellow flex-direction one.\n\nLearn more about flexbox by reading this helpful, visual and complete reference to the many properties you can use with flexbox.\nComplete exercises 11-17 from the exercise project.\nGit Merging\nLast week you used Git to create a branch so that you could work on two different copies of your project at the same time.\n\nThis week you will learn how to merge your changes in one branch back to your master branch.\n\nComplete exercise 18 from the exercise project.\nResources\nUse the following resources to learn more about the topics we covered this week.\n\nA Complete Guide to Flexbox\n\nHomework\n\n(Est. 1-2 hours) Complete the \"Common Responsive Patterns\" lesson of the Responsive Web Design Fundamentals course.\n\n(Est. 4 hours) Follow along to as many videos as you can from What the Flexbox?!.

Complete the instructions under \"For Week 2\".\n\n\nExtra Credit\nThis week you learned how to layout content in CSS with Flexbox. In your work, you may be asked to use other layout techniques, such as CSS Grid, floats, or absolute positioning. Read about CSS Grids, and floats and absolute positioning.\nPrepare for the next class\n\n(Est. 1-2 hours) Next week we will learn how to collect user input. Read about HTML forms and see how much you can understand on your own.\n\n"},"html-css/week-03/lesson.html":{"url":"html-css/week-03/lesson.html","title":"Week 3 - HTML Forms","keywords":"","body":"\nHTML/CSS 3\nWhat will we learn today?\n\nWhat are forms?\nThe HTML Form\nFields\nLabels\nButtons\nMore Field Types\nAccessibility\nFieldsets\nForm Attributes\nGit Merge Conflicts\nRetrospective\n\nWhat are forms?\nForms are used everywhere on the web. You use them every day when you log into Slack, send an email, post to Facebook or sign up for services. Any time you enter information into a website, you are using a form.\n\nGroup Exercise: Look at the forms below. Can we identify the fields, labels and buttons that are used in these forms?\n\n\n\n\n\nThe HTML Form\nA form always starts with a  tag and ends with . The action attribute is used to tell the form where to send the data.\nThe example below submits the form to Google's search engine.\n\n  ...\n\n\nThe method attribute can be set to GET or POST. Use GET when the user is requesting information from the server. Use POST when the user is sending information to the server.\nSome examples of forms and the most common method they will use:\n\n\n\nPurpose\nMost Common Method\n\n\n\n\nSearch for something\nGET\n\n\nSend a message\nPOST\n\n\nEdit your profile\nPOST\n\n\nLogin\nPOST\n\n\nCreate account\nPOST\n\n\n\nWhen we search on Google, we are requesting information. We should use the GET method.\n\n  ...\n\n\nFields\nForms ask the user to enter information. To do this, users need HTML elements where they can type, select, check or click to provide information. We call these elements \"fields\".\nThe most common fields are ,  and .\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Brazil\n  Croatia\n  Ethiopia\n  Laos\n  Uganda\n\n\n\n  Brazil\n  Croatia\n  Ethiopia\n  Laos\n  Uganda\n\n\n\nEach field must have a unique name attribute. If two fields share the same name attribute, the value of one will be dropped when the information is sent.\nField elements should be nested inside of a  element.\n\n  \n\n\nLabels\nLabels are used to tell the user what information they should put into each field. Fields can be nested inside of a  to link the information with the field.\n\n  Username\n  \n\n\nSometimes you want to keep the  and the  separate. In that case, labels and fields can be linked together with the for and id attributes.\nUsername\n\n\nEvery field must have a . A field that does not have a  can not be used by someone with a visual impairment, even if it has other text to describe it.\nButtons\nButtons are used for many things. The most common purpose is to submit a form. When used to submit a form, they must have a type attribute with a value of submit.\nSearch Now\n\nSearch Now\n\nWhen a user clicks on a submit button, the information in the form is sent to the form's action attribute.\n\n  Search Now\n\n\n\nSearch Now\n\n\nComplete exercises 19, 20 and 21 from week 3 of the HTML, CSS and Git Exercises.\nMore Field Types\nDifferent kinds of text\nThere are many  types that can be used to collect different information, such as phone numbers, email addresses, numbers and more. Here are some examples.\n\nPhone Number: \nEmail Address: \nNumbers: \nURL: \nAnd several more.\n\nEach  type identifies what kind of information should be entered. For example, phones will show different keyboards depending on if you are entering a phone number, a URL, or an email address.\n\nWant to learn more? Read about all of the input types.\n\nCheckboxes\nA checkbox allows the user to say yes or no to an option. With a checkbox, the user does not type the value into the field. You have to provide the value in a value attribute.\n\n  \n  Would you like to receive discounts by email?\n\n\n\n  \n  Would you like to receive discounts by email?\n\n\n\nCheckboxes that are related to each other can be grouped together in a . A group of fields is described by a .\n\n  What languages do you speak?\n  \n    \n    Arabic\n  \n  \n    \n    Spanish\n  \n  \n    \n    English\n  \n\n\n\n  What languages do you speak?\n  \n    \n    Arabic\n  \n  \n    \n    Spanish\n  \n  \n    \n    English\n  \n\n\n\n\nGroup Discussion: Checkboxes are an exception to the rule that every field must have a unique name attribute. In the example above, all three checkboxes have the same name attribute. What do you think will happen when more than one checkbox is selected?\n\nRadio Buttons\nRadio buttons are just like checkboxes, except the user can only select one option.\n\n  What is your preferred language?\n  \n    \n    Arabic\n  \n  \n    \n    Spanish\n  \n  \n    \n    English\n  \n\n\n\n  What is your preferred language?\n  \n    \n    Arabic\n  \n  \n    \n    Spanish\n  \n  \n    \n    English\n  \n\n\n\nComplete exercises 22, 23 and 24 from week 3 of the HTML, CSS and Git Exercises.\nAccessibility\nAll fields must have a  and all fieldsets must have a . Sometimes you will have a form field that doesn't need a label. For example, a search field is often identified with an icon and a placeholder attribute.\n&#x1F50D; \n\n&#x1F50D; \nThis is clear for most users, but not for the visually impaired, who use a screen reader to browse the web. These users can not see the icon next to the field and their assistive technology may not read out the placeholder text.\nYou must add a  in order to be accessible to all users.\nSearch\n&#x1F50D; \n\nSearch\n&#x1F50D; \nFor sighted users, it now looks like there are two labels. In these circumstances, we use special CSS code to visually hide the label.\nHTML:\nSearch\n&#x1F50D; \n\nCSS:\n.screenreader {\n  clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\n  position: absolute !important;\n  left: -2000px;\n}\n\nSearch\n&#x1F50D; \n\nGroup Discussion: What are our obligations as software developers to make sure everyone can access the websites we build? How might people suffer if they can't access the web?\n\nFieldsets\nFieldsets can be used for any fields that are grouped together. This is often used to distinguish two groups of similar fields.\n\n  Mother\n  Given Name\n  \n  Family Name\n  \n\n\n  Father\n  Given Name\n  \n  Family Name\n  \n\n\n\n  Mother\n  Given Name\n  \n  Family Name\n  \n\n\n  Father\n  Given Name\n  \n  Family Name\n  \n\n\n\nComplete exercises 25 and 26 from week 3 of the HTML, CSS and Git Exercises.\nForm Attributes\nThere are many attributes you can use on ,  and  fields.\nRequired\nA field with the required attribute will not allow the form to be submitted until the user has entered information.\n\n\nValue\nThe value attribute can be added to an  field to pre-fill information. This is often used when a website remembers your username during login.\n\n\n\n\nReadonly\nThe readonly attribute can be added to ,  and  fields to prevent the user from making changes to the field.\n\n\n\n\nChecked\nThe checked attribute can be added to a checkbox or radio button to pre-check the field. This is often used to select a default that the user may not want to change.\n\n  What languages do you speak?\n  \n    \n    Arabic\n  \n  \n    \n    Spanish\n  \n  \n    \n    English\n  \n\n\n\n  What languages do you speak?\n  \n    \n    Arabic\n  \n  \n    \n    Spanish\n  \n  \n    \n    English\n  \n\n\nComplete exercise 27 from week 3 of the HTML, CSS and Git Exercises.\nGit Merge Conflicts\nLast week you used Git to merge your changes from one branch back into your master branch.\n\nSometimes Git can not automatically merge one branch into another, because each branch has modified the same line of code. Git does not know which version of the line is the correct one. When this happens, we have a \"merge conflict\".\n\nAs a developer, you have to tell Git which version of the line of code is correct.\nComplete exercise 28 from week 3 of the HTML, CSS and Git Exercises to learn how to resolve a merge conflict.\nRetrospective\nAt the end of each module, we'll have a retrospective. What went right? What went wrong? What do we need to do as a group to learn better? Let's discuss the HTML/CSS module.\nResources\n\nHTML Forms at Marksheet.io\nBuilding Forms at ShayHowe.com\n\nHomework\n\n(Est. 1-2 hours) Complete Lesson 1 of this course on Building High Conversion Web Forms.\n(Est. 1-2  hours) Complete videos 1-16 in Lesson 2 of the same course as above. You can stop after lesson 17.\nRevise what you've learned during the HTML/CSS module. Next lesson we'll have a short quiz for you.\n\nPrepare for the next class\nNext lesson, we will begin learning and programming JavaScript.

This is the repo we will use during the class, and for homework.\n\nInstall Node\nWindows and Mac users\nDownload the installer (.msi or .pkg) from https://nodejs.org/en/download\n\nLinux (Ubuntu) users\nRun the following commands in your terminal:\n  curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_8.x | sudo -E bash -\n  sudo apt-get install -y nodejs\n\nSource: https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/#debian-and-ubuntu-based-linux-distributions\n\nA note on security: This will require you to enter a password. Don't execute a script on your terminal if you don't trust its source, especially if they use the sudo command to get admin access to your machine.\n\n2. Test installation\nGo to your terminal and run the command: node -v.\nYou should get the node version printed on your terminal. For example, v8.9.3.\nSetup IDE\nThere are some tools that will help you to write code. One of these, Prettier, formats your code, making it easier for you and others to read.\n1. Install prettier\n\nIn Visual Studio open the extensions panel (see https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-gallery#_browse-and-install-extensions)\nSearch for Prettier - Code formatter\nClick install on the top result\n\n2. Enable formatting on save\n\nIn Visual Studio open the settings file (see https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/settings#_creating-user-and-workspace-settings)\nSearch for editor format\nSet editor.formatOnSave and editor.formatOnPaste to true\n\nHello World\nIt is programming tradition that the first thing you do in any language is make it output 'Hello world!'.\nWe'll do this in JavaScript, using a command called console.log().\nInside of exercise.js there's a line of code that will print \"Hello world!\".\n1. Run the program\n\nOpen a terminal window\nChange directory to this folder (cd week-1/C-hello-world)\nRun the program using node (node exercise.js)\n\n2. Experiment\n\nTry to console.log() something different. For example, 'Hello World. I just started learning JavaScript!'.\nTry to console.log() several things at once.\nWhat happens when you get rid of the quote marks?\nWhat happens when you console.log() just a number without quotes?\n\nVariables\nWhen you write code, you'll want to create shortcuts to data values so you can don't have to write out the same value every time.\nWe can use variable to create a reference to a value.\nvar greeting = \"Hello world\";\n\nconsole.log(greeting);\n\nThe program above will print \"Hello world\" to the console. Notice how it uses the value assigned to the variable greeting.\nExercise\n\nAdd a variable greeting to exercise.js (make sure it comes before the console.log)\nPrint your greeting to the console 3 times\n\n\nRemember: to run this exercise you must change directory to the D-variables. If you already have a terminal window open for the previous exercise you can do this by running the command cd ../D-variables.\n\nExpected result\nHello world\nHello world\nHello world\n\nStrings\nIn programming there are different types of data. You've used one data type already: string.\nComputers recognise strings as a sequence of characters but to humans, strings are simply lines of text.\nvar message = \"This is a string\";\n\nNotice that strings are always wrapped inside of quote marks. We do this so that the computer knows when the string starts and ends.\nYou can check that the data is a string by using the typeof operator:\nvar message = \"This is a string\";\nvar messageType = typeof message;\n\nconsole.log(messageType); // logs 'string'\n\nExercise\n\nWrite a program that logs a message and its type\n\nExpected result\nThis is a string\nstring\n\nString concatenation\nYou can add two strings together using the plus operator (+):\nvar greetingStart = \"Hello, my name is \";\nvar name = \"Daniel\";\n\nvar greeting = greetingStart + name;\n\nconsole.log(greeting); // Logs \"Hello, my name is Daniel\"\n\nExercise\n\nWrite a program that logs a message with a greeting and your name\n\nExpected result\nHello, my name is Daniel\n\nNumbers\nThe next data type we will learn is number.\nUnlike strings, numbers do not need to be wrapped in quotes.\nvar age = 30;\n\nYou can use mathematical operators to caclulate numbers:\nvar sum = 10 + 2; // 12\nvar product = 10 * 2; // 20\nvar quotient = 10 / 2; // 5\nvar difference = 10 - 2; // 8\n\nExercise\n\nCreate two variables numberOfStudents and numberOfMentors\nLog a message that displays the total number of students and mentors\n\nExpected result\nNumber of students: 15\nNumber of mentors: 8\nTotal numnber of students and mentors: 23\n\nFloats\nNumbers can be integers (whole numbers) or floats (numbers with a decimal).\nvar preciseAge = 30.612437;\n\nFloats can be rounded to the nearest whole number using the Math.round function:\nvar preciseAge = 30.612437;\nvar roughAge = Math.round(preciseAge); // 30\n\nExercise\n\nUsing the variables provided in the exercise calculate the percentage of mentors and students in the group\n\nExpected result\nPercentage students: 65%\nPercentage mentors: 35%\n\nFunctions\nFunctions are blocks of code that can do a task as many times as you ask it to. They take an input and return an output.\nHere's a function that doubles a number:\nfunction double(number) {\n  return number * 2;\n}\n\nTo use the function we need to:\na) call it with an input and\nb) assign the returned value to a variable\nvar result = double(2);\n\nconsole.log(result); // 4\n\nExercise 1\n\nComplete the function in exercise.js so that it halves the input\nTry calling the function more than once with some different numbers\n\n\nRemember to use the return keyword to get a value out of the function\n\nExpected result\n6\n\nExercise 2\n\nComplete the function in exercise2.js so that it triples the input\n\nExpected result\n24\n\nFunction Parameters\nThe input given to a function is called a parameter.\nA function can take more than one parameter:\nfunction add(a, b) {\n  return a + b;\n}\n\nWhen you write a function (sometimes called declaring a function) you assign names to the parameters inside of the parentheses (()). Parameters can be called anything.\nThis function is exactly the same as the on above:\nfunction add(num1, num2) {\n  return num1 + num2;\n}\n\nExercise 1\n\nWrite a function that multiplies two numbers together\n\nExpected result\n12\n\nExercise 2\n\nFrom scratch, write a function that divides two numbers\n\nExpected result\n0.75\n\nExercise 3\n\nWrite a function that takes a name (a string) and returns a greeting\n\nExpected result\nHello, my name is Daniel\n\nExercise 4\n\nWrite a function that adds two numbers together\nCall the function, passing 13 and 124 as parameters, and assigning the returned value to a variable sum\n\nExpected result\n137\n\nExercise 5\n\nWrite a function that takes a name (a string) and an age (a number) and returns a greeting (a string)\n\nExpected result\nHello, my name is Daniel and I'm 30 years old\n\nNested Functions\nFunctions are very powerful.\n\nYou can write more than one line of code inside of functions.\nYou can use variables inside of functions.\nYou can call other functions inside of functions!\n\nfunction getAgeInDays(age) {\n  return age * 365;\n}\n\nfunction createCreeting(name, age) {\n  var ageInDays = getAgeInDays(age);\n  var message =\n    \"My Name is \" + name + \" and I was born over \" + ageInDays + \" days ago!\";\n  return message;\n}\n\nExercise 1\n\nIn exercise.js write a program that displays the percentage of students and mentors in the group\nThe percentage should be rounded to the nearest whole number (use a search engine to find out how to this with JavaScript)\nYou should have one function that calculates the percentage, and one function that creates a message\n\n\nConsider: should your percentage function do the rounding, or should it be done when the greeting is created?\n\nExpected result\nPercentage students: 65%\nPercentage mentors: 35%\n\nExercise 2\n\nIn exercise2.js you have been provided with the names of some mentors. Write a program that logs a shouty greeting to each one.\nYour program should include a function that spells their name in uppercase, and a function that creates a shouty greeting.\nLog each greeting to the console.\n\nExpected result\nHELLO DANIEL\nHELLO IRINA\nHELLO MIMI\nHELLO ROB\nHELLO YOHANNES\n\nHomework\n\nThe repo that you\nhave forked during this class contains few challenges - solve all the pending exercises in week-1 and week-1-practise in\nJavaScript!\n\n"},"js-core/week-05/lesson.html":{"url":"js-core/week-05/lesson.html","title":"Week 5 - Arrays","keywords":"","body":"\nJavaScript Core I - 2\nWhat we will learn today?\n\nExpressions\nBoolean Filters\nComparison operators\nPredicates\nConditionals\nLogical Operators\nMore Conditionals\nArray literals\nArray properties\nArray getters and setters\nArray methods\nMore Array methods\nArray map\n\n\n\nPlease make sure you're working on the js-exercises repo Week 2 folder during this class.\n\nExpressions\nIn JavaScript there are expressions and statements. We will use these words frequently to describe code.\nExpression\nAn expression returns a value. Sometimes we will say that an expression evaluates to a value.\nThe following are all examples of expressions:\n1 + 1; // returns 2\n(\"hello\"); // returns \"hello\"\n2 * 4; // returns 8\n\"hello\" + \"world\"; // returns \"helloworld\"\n\nWe can take the value produced by an expression and assign it to a variable. That line of code would be called a statement.\nStatement\nA statement is some code that performs an action. Here are some examples:\nvar sum = 1 + 1; // action: assigns result of `1 + 1` to variable `sum`\nvar greeting = \"hello\"; // action: assigns result of the expression \"hello\" to variable `greeting`\nconsole.log(2 * 4); // action: logs the result of `2 * 4` to the console\nsayGreeting(greeting); // action: calls the function `sayGreeting` with the parameter `greeting`\n\nThere are some other different types of statements that we will learn in the coming weeks.\nExercise\nYou quickly find out the result of an expression by running node in a terminal window.\n\nOpen a terminal window\nRun the command node\nYou have now opened a node console (also called a REPL)\nType an expression and press enter\nTo exit the console type Ctrl+C or type the command .exit\n\nExample from inside a terminal window:\n$ node\n> 1 + 2\n3\n> \"hello\"\n'hello'\n> var greeting = \"hello\"\nundefined\n> greeting\n'hello'\n> console.log(greeting)\nhello\nundefined\n> .exit\n$\n\n\nNotice how when we execute an expression the value it produces is printed below it. When we execute a statement, we see undefined printed below. This is because statements don't produce values like expressions, they do something.\n\n\nWrite some more expressions in the node console\nAssign some expressions to variables\nCheck the value of the variables\n\nFurther reading on using the node console: https://hackernoon.com/know-node-repl-better-dbd15bca0af6\nBoolean Filters\nThere is a special data type in JavaScript known as a boolean value. A boolean is either true or false, and it should be written without quotes.\nvar codeYourFutureIsGreat = true;\n\nExercise\nHead over to exercise.js and follow the instructions in the comments.\nComparison Operators\nWe can also write expressions that return boolean values.\nHere's an expression that evaluates to a boolean.\n1 > 2\n\n\nCan you work out what value this expression evaluates to?\n\nThe > symbol in the expression is a comparison operator. Comparison operators compare two values. This operator checks to see if the number on the left is bigger than the number on the right.\n1 is not bigger than 2 so this expression returns false.\nMore comparison operators\n>   greater than\n=  greater than or equal\n=== same value\n!== not the same value\n\nExercise\n\nOpen exercise.js and follow the instructions.\nOpen a node console, and write some expressions that use comparison operators\n\nPredicates\nPredicate is a fancy word for a function that returns a boolean value.\nThese functions are very useful because they let you test if a value satisifies certain requirements.\nfunction isNumber(value) {\n  return typeof value === \"number\";\n}\n\nisNumber(10); // returns true\nisNumber(\"hello\"); // returns false\n\nJavaScript programmers often give predicate functions a name that starts with a verb e.g. isBig, isNegative, isActive, shouldUpdate,\nCalling a predicate function is like asking a question: \"is this value a number\". The return value is the answer to your question.\nConditionals\nLike humans, computer programs make decisions based on information given to them. Conditionals are a way of representing these decisions in code.\nFor example:\n\nIn a game, if the player has 0 lives, then the game is over\nIn a weather app, if rain is forecast, a picture of rain clouds is shown\n\nThe most common type of conditional is the if statement.\nAn if statment runs some code if a condition is met. If the condition is not met, then the code will be skipped.\nvar isHappy = true;\n\nif (isHappy) {\n  console.log(\"I am happy\");\n}\n\nThe code in paratheses - e.g. (isHappy) - is the condition. The condition can be any expression. The following are all valid conditions:\n// boolean value\nif (true) {\n  // do something\n}\n\n// variable assigned to boolean value\nif (isHappy) {\n  // do something\n}\n\n// equality operator returns a boolean value\nif (1 + 1 === 2) {\n  // do something\n}\n\n// comparison operator returns a boolean value\nif (10 > 5) {\n  // do something\n}\n\n// function call returns boolean value\nif (greaterThan10(5)) {\n  // do something\n}\n\nAn if statement runs code when a condition is met. What if the condition is not met? Sometimes you want to run an alternative bit of code.\nAn if...else statement also runs code when the condition is not met.\nvar isHappy = true;\n\nif (isHappy) {\n  console.log(\"I am happy &#x1F604;\");\n} else {\n  console.log(\"I am not happy &#x1F622;\");\n}\n\nLogical Operators\nThere are three logical operators in JavaScript: || (OR), && (AND), ! (NOT).\nThey let you write expressions that evaluate to a boolean value.\nSuppose you want to test if a number if bigger than 3 and smaller than 10. We can write this using logical operators.\nvar num = 10;\n\nfunction satisfiesRequirements(num) {\n  if (num > 3 && num \nWe can test expressions with logical operators in a node console too:\n$ node\n> var num = 10;\nundefined\n> num > 5 && num  num  false || true\ntrue\n> !true\nfalse\n> var greaterThan5 = num > 5\nundefined\n> !greaterThan5\nfalse\n> !(num === 10)\nfalse\n\nMore Conditionals\nA common use of if statements is inside of functions.\nfunction getGrade(score) {\n  if (score >= 80) {\n    return \"A\";\n  }\n  if (score >= 60) {\n    return \"B\";\n  }\n}\n\nYou can also write this using else if:\nfunction getGrade(score) {\n  if (score >= 80) {\n    return \"A\";\n  } else if (score >= 60) {\n    return \"B\";\n  }\n}\n\nArray Literals\nIf you ever find yourself writing code like this...\nvar mentor1 = \"Daniel\";\nvar mentor2 = \"Irina\";\nvar mentor3 = \"Rares\";\n\n...then it's probably time to use an array!\nArrays are data structures that hold a list of values.\nvar mentors = [\"Daniel\", \"Irina\", \"Rares\"];\n\nArrays can hold any type of value (although almost always you only have one data type per array).\nvar testScores = [16, 49, 85];\nvar grades = [\"F\", \"D\", \"A\"];\nvar greetings = [\"Hello, how are you?\", \"Hi! Nice to meet you!\"];\n\nArray properties\nArrays, like strings, have a length property.\nYou can check this by starting a node console in your terminal.\n$ node\n> var arr = [1, 2, 3];\nundefined\n> arr\n[1, 2, 3]\n> arr.length\n3\n\nArray Getters and Setters\nYou can get a single value out of an array using bracket notation.\n$ node\n> var ingredients = [\"Flour\", \"Water\", \"Salt\"];\nundefined\n> ingredients[0]\nFlour\n> ingredients[1]\nWater\n> ingredients.length\n3\n\nDid you notice how we use [0] to get the first value? In programming we count starting at zero.\n\nThe number inside of the brackets is called an index. Index just means the position of the item within the array.\n\nYou can also set a value using bracket notation and an assignment operator (=).\nvar scores = [80, 41, 47];\n\nscores[2] = 29; // Change the last score\nscores[3] = 51; // Add a new score\n\nArray methods\nDo you remember how strings have special functions called methods? Don't worry if not! Here's an example to jog your memory:\n$ node\n> var name = \"Daniel\"\nundefined\n> name.toLowerCase()\ndaniel\n\nArrays also have several methods that you can use.\n.sort()\nAn array method that sorts the values in an array into ascending alphabetical order.\nvar unorderedLetters = [\"z\", \"v\", \"b\", \"f\", \"g\"];\nvar orderedLetters = unorderedLetters.sort();\n\nconsole.log(orderedLetters); // logs [ 'b', 'f', 'g', 'v', 'z' ]\n\n\nWhen you call an array method it uses the array on the left side of the dot as an input, and returns a new, transformed, array.\n\n.concat()\nAdds (or concatenates) another value or array to the array.\n$ node\n> var arr = [1, 2, 3]\nundefined\n> arr.concat(4)\n[1, 2, 3, 4]\n> arr\n[1, 2, 3]\n\nDid you notice how calling the concat method did not change arr? This is because concat, like most array methods, returns a new array, it does not alter the one you called the method on.\nIf you wan to use the array returned by calling .concat() you should store it in a new variable.\nvar arr = [1, 2, 3];\nvar newArr = arr.concat(4);\n\nconsole.log(newArr); // logs [1, 2, 3, 4]\n\nMore Array methods\nLet's explore some more array methods.\n.slice()\nReturns a slice of the array.\nYou can tell .slice() where you want the slice to begin and end by passing it two parameters.\n$ node\n> var arr = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]\nundefined\n> arr.slice(0, 2)\n[0, 1]\n> [\"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"d\"].slice(1, 2)\n['b']\n\n.includes()\nReturns true if a value is in the array.\nvar mentors = [\"Daniel\", \"Irini\", \"Ashleigh\", \"Rob\", \"Etzali\"];\n\nfunction isAMentor(name) {\n  return mentors.includes(name);\n}\n\nconsooe.log(\"Is Rukmuni a mentor?\");\nconsole.log(isAMentor(\"Rukmini\")); // logs false\n\n.join()\nReturns all the array values joined together in a string.\n$ node\n> [\"H\", \"e\", \"l\", \"l\", \"o\"].join()\n'Hello'\n\nThere is a string method .split(). In an interactive console try using the string .split() method and the array .join(). How could they work together?\nArray map\nImagine you have an array of names...\nvar mentors = [\"Daniel \", \"irina \", \" Gordon\", \"ashleigh \"];\n\nYou notice that he names are not formatted consistently. To fix the array you decide you need to trim whitespace and convert to lowercase. How do you do that for every value in the array?\nWe can write a function that changes one name:\nfunction tidy(name) {\n  return name.trim().toLowerCase();\n}\n\nAll you need to run every name in the array through this function and update the array values. Thankfully there is an array method that does just this!\n.map()\nRuns every item in the array through a function and returns a new array with the values returned by the function.\nvar tidyMentors = mentors.map(tidy);\n\nconsole.log(tidyMentors); // logs [\"daniel\", \"irina\", \"gordon\", \"ashleigh\"]\n\nHomework\n\nThe repo contains few challenges - solve all the pending exercises in week-2 and week-2-practise.\n\n"},"js-core/week-06/lesson.html":{"url":"js-core/week-06/lesson.html","title":"Week 6 - More Arrays","keywords":"","body":"\nJavaScript Core I - 3\nWhat we will learn today?\n\nArray Find\nArray Some\nArray Every\nArray Filter\nArray Map\nArray ForEach\n\n\n\nPlease make sure you're working on the js-exercises repo Week 3 during this class.\n\nArray find\nImagine you have an array of names:\nvar names = [\"Daniel\", \"James\", \"Irina\", \"Mozafar\", \"Ashleigh\"];\n\nHow would you find the first name that's longer than 6 characters?\nYou can write a predicate function that checks if a string is longer than 6 characters:\nfunction isLongName(name) {\n  return name.length > 6;\n}\n\nTo find the first item that satisfies the predicate you would have to go through each array item, and pass it into isLongName.

How do you do that for every value in the array?\nWe can write a function that checks if one score is greater than 80:\nfunction isHighScore(score) {\n  return score > 80;\n}\n\nTo find out which scores were greater than 80, you'd have to run this function against every score in the array, and push the 80+ scores into a new array.

This week we'll study how it works in more depth.\nYou might remember this example:\nfunction double(number) {\n  return number * 2;\n}\n\nvar numbers = [1, 2, 3];\nvar numbersDoubled = numbers.map(double);\n\nThe map() method runs the function we provided (double) on each item in the array and uses the return values to create a new array. In the example numbersDoubled is a new array containing [2, 4, 6].\nCallback functions\nA function that we provide to a method is commonly called a callback function. The term highlights that although we provide the double function, the .map() method calls it. (Notice how we never write double() to call the function).\nWe'll see callback functions used a lot more in the coming weeks. \nOften, when a function is only needed for a map operation, developers will declare the callback function inside of the method call. Let's try copying and pasting the function declaration inside of the .map() method call.\nvar numbers = [1, 2, 3];\nvar numbersDoubled = numbers.map(function double(number) {\n  return number * 2;\n});\n\nWe can make this shorter by removing the function name. We can do this because we are not using the function anywhere else in the code, so we do not need the function name to reference it.\nvar numbers = [1, 2, 3];\nvar numbersDoubled = numbers.map(function (number) {\n  return number * 2;\n});\n\nWe can make this code even shorter still. In the latest versions of JavaScript a way of declaring functions was introduced called arrow functions. \nvar numbers = [1, 2, 3];\nvar numbersDoubled = numbers.map(number => {\n  return number * 2\n});\n\nThe arrow function syntax lets you declare a function without the function keyword. (There are some other subtle differences between arrow functions and regular functions that you will learn about at a much later stage).\nThere is one last thing you can do to make your code shorter. If you remove the braces ({}) from an arrow function, the body of the function will be returned without needing to write the return keyword.\nvar numbers = [1, 2, 3];\nvar numbersDoubled = numbers.map(number => number * 2);\n\nIn the example above, the expression number * 2 is automatically returned because it comes directly after the => arrow (instead of coming after curly braces). This is called an implicit return.\nArray Foreach\nThe .forEach() method is similar to .map() except it does not return a new array. Therefore .forEach() is only useful if you want to perform side effects.\nSide effects\nGenerally, functions should take an input and return an output (based on that input), and not do anything else.\nWhen functions meet this criteria they can be called pure functions.\nA pure function does not:\n\naccess any data unless it was passed in as a parameter\nchange data declared outside the function\ninteracts with anything outside of the function (e.g. logs a message to the console, shows a message on a website, saves data to disk)\n\nThese are all example of side effects. Of course, from time to time, we will need to perform side effects, but we should try to avoid side effects inside of functions and only have them when absolutely necessary.\nExample\nSay we want to log to the console a list of names.\nvar names = [\"Daniel\", \"mozafar\", \"irina\"];\n\nWe can use .forEach() to go through the array, item by item, and call a function we provide.\nnames.forEach(function(name, index) {\n  console.log(index + \": \" + name);\n});\n\nThis logs each name to the console as hoped, but we notice that the names are not formatted correctly. You might be tempted to format the name inside of the forEach function.\nHowever, it is good practise to write small functions with a single responsibility. So instead, we can write a formatName function (which we can re-use in other places) and pass it to .map() before calling .forEach().\nfunction formatName(name) {\n  return name.split(\"\")[0].toUpperCase() + name.slice(1);\n}\n\nnames.map(formatName).forEach(function(name, index) {\n  console.log(index + \": \" + name);\n});\n\nChaining\nNotice how we were able to write one method after another e.g. names.map(formatName).forEach(log)? This is called method chaining.\nYou can call .forEach() after .map() because .map() returns a new array.\nConsider this code:\nvar namesFormatted = names.map(format);\nnamesFormatted.forEach(log);\n\nIt can be written more simply (without assigning the array returned from .map() to a variable):\nnames.map(format).forEach(log);\n\nBe careful though! You can not call .map() after .forEach.\nnames.forEach(log).map(formatName); // ERROR\n\nThis code does not work because forEach() does not return a new array (it returns undefined). The code is therefore attempting to call .map() on undefined, and undefined does not have a .map() method.\nHomework\n\nMake sure you finish all the pending exercies in The repo.\n\nSignup to CodeWars and work on these challenges\n\n\nfunctions, types, conditionals etc...\n\neven or odd\ncode under pressure\nsecret message\nconvert boolean\nopposite number\nreturn negative\nhydrated\nbonus\nremove string spaces\nremove first and last character\nstring repeat\nmathematical operations\n\nArrays (optional)\n\ninvert values\nneedle in haystack\ncounting sheep\nsum of positive\npeople in bus\nsum without highest and lowest\nreveersed array of digits\nslash sum of negatives\n\n"},"js-core-2/":{"url":"js-core-2/","title":"JavaScript II","keywords":"","body":"JavaScript Core 2\n\n\n\nWeek\nContent\n\n\n\n\nweek-07\nObjects\n\n\nweek-08\nJS in the Browser (DOM, and AJAX)\n\n\nweek-09\nMore JS in the Browser\n\n\n\n"},"js-core-2/week-07/lesson.html":{"url":"js-core-2/week-07/lesson.html","title":"Week 7 - Objects","keywords":"","body":"\nJavaScript Core II - 1\nWhat we will learn today?\n\nObjects\nObjects Get and Set\nMore complex objects\nObject methods\nArrays of Objects\nObject.Keys()\n\n\n\nPlease make sure you're working on the js-exercises repo Week 4 during this class.\n\nObjects\nObjects in the real world have properties that describe how they are unique. Your laptop, for example, has a brand (Lenovo/Apple etc.), a screen size (13/15 inch), RAM (8/16GB) etc.\nHow would we describe the above laptop as a JavaScript object?\nvar laptop = {\n    brand: \"Lenovo\",\n    screenSize: 13,\n    isTouchscreen: true\n};\n\nUseful words to remember when talking about objects:\n\nobject literal: anything that has a set of {...} around a set of properties is an object literal\nproperty or key: brand, screenSize and isTouchScreen are properties/keys of the object\nvalues: \"Lenovo\", 13 and true are values of the object's properties\n\nObjects Get and Set\nGetting the value of an object's property\nLet's take one of the objects we looked at earlier..\nvar laptop = {\n    brand: \"Lenovo\",\n    screenSize: 13,\n    isTouchscreen: true\n};\n\n\nTry to console.log(laptop). The output might depend on your environment!\n\nTo find out the value of an object's property, you can use the dot notation..\nconsole.log(laptop.brand);\n\nYou can also use the bracket notation (although this is rarely used, it's good to know):\nconsole.log(laptop['brand']);\n\nSetting the value of a property\nSimilar to reading, if we want to set a property:\nlaptop.brand = \"Apple\";\n\nIt's strongly recommended you always use the same type when re-assigning an object's property (if it was a string before, keep it a string - and so on).\nvar laptop = {\n    brand: \"Lenovo\",\n    screenSize: 13,\n    isTouchscreen: true\n};\n\n// DON'T DO THIS\nlaptop.screenSize = \"15 inch\";\n\n// OK TO DO\nlaptop.screenSize = 15;\n\nMore Complex Objects\n Object properties can even be assigned other objects or variables too. The example below shows an object with keys that have been assigned a variable, an array, and an object.\nvar kittenName = \"Feathers\";\n\nvar kitten = {\n    name: kittenName,\n    toyCollection: ['blue ball', 'green ball', 'hoover box'],\n    favoriteLocation: {\n        roomName: 'Living room',\n        napPlace: 'window',\n        idealTemperatureCelsius: 24\n    }\n};\n\nObject Methods\nBesides having specific properties, objects in the real world can also do things. For example, a computer can display something on the screen, a person can say their names etc... In Javascript, we do this using 'methods'. A method is a function attached to a particular object. You have already used some predefined methods before, for example toUpperCase() on a string or filter() on an array.\nvar athlete = {\n    name: 'Usain Bolt',\n    goldMedals: 25,\n    sayHi: function() {\n        return \"Hi everybody!\";\n    }\n};\n\nHow do we call this method? \nathlete.sayHi(); // returns \"Hi everybody!\"\n\nAn object method can also rely on the other properties of the object to do more complex calculation. To reference the current object in the body of the method, we will use the keyword this. Let's take an example.\nvar athlete = {\n    name: 'Usain Bolt',\n    goldMedals: 25,\n    sayName: function() {\n        return \"My name is \" + this.name;\n    }\n};\n\nathlete.sayName(); // returns \"My name is Usain Bolt\"\n\nKnowing this, you can have methods which modify existing properties of your object.\nvar athlete = {\n    name: 'Usain Bolt',\n    goldMedals: 25,\n    winNewMedal: function() {\n        this.goldMedals = this.goldMedals + 1;\n    }\n};\n\nathlete.winNewMedal();\nconsole.log(athelete.goldMedals); // prints \"26\"\n\nAs methods are just functions attached to objects, they can also take parameters.\nvar athlete = {\n    name: 'Usain Bolt',\n    goldMedals: 25,\n    silverMedals: 7,\n    winNewMedal: function(medal) {\n        if (medal === \"gold\") {\n            this.goldMedals = this.goldMedals + 1;\n        } else {\n            this.silverMedals = this.silverMedals + 1;\n        }\n    }\n};\n\nathlete.winNewMedal(\"silver\");\nconsole.log(athlete.goldMedals); // prints \"25\"\nconsole.log(athlete.silverMedals); // prints \"8\"\n\nArrays of objects\nIn the past weeks, you've learned about using arrays of numbers, arrays of string etc... In the following, we will learn how to use arrays of objects.\nvar kitten1 = {\n    name: 'Fluffy',\n    weeksOld: 2\n};\n\nvar kitten2 = {\n    name: 'Megatron',\n    weeksOld: 1\n};\n\nvar kitten3 = {\n    name: 'Billy',\n    weeksOld: 5\n};\n\nvar kittens = [kitten1, kitten2, kitten3];\n\nYou can also use all the functions for arrays that you learned before: find, some, every, filter, map, forEach... As an example, we want to filter all the kittens who are less than 3 weeks old:\nfunction isYoungerThan3Weeks(kitten) {\n    return kitten.weeksOld \nWhat if we want to get an array of all the kitties names?\nfunction getName(kitten) {\n    return kitten.name;\n}\n\nkittens.map(getName);   // returns [\"Fluffy\", \"Megatron\", \"Billy\"]\n\nObject.Keys()\nSince we started JavaScript, we have used console.log to print things to our console.\nIn week 2 and 3, you learned about array methods like .map(), .length().\nThese are what we call built-in methods, and they're part of the JavaScript language. Someone else created these methods, and we can use them in our code.\nLike arrays, objects have build in methods that can help us. In this lesson, we will learn about Object.keys(). This method goes into our object, and returns the object property names as an array.\nHere is an example output for using .keys():\nvar footballClubs = {\n  chelsea_fc: 'England',\n  fc_barcelona: 'Spain',\n  ac_milan: 'Italy'\n};\n\nconsole.log(Object.keys(footballClubs));\n// prints [ 'chelsea_fc', 'fc_barcelona', 'ac_milan' ]\n\nHomework\n\nThe repo contains few challenges - solve all the pending exercises in week-4 and week-4-practise.\n\n"},"js-core-2/week-08/lesson.html":{"url":"js-core-2/week-08/lesson.html","title":"Week 8 - JS in the Browser","keywords":"","body":"\nJavaScript Core II - 2\nWhat we will learn today?\n\nJS In the Browser (The DOM)\nAJAX\n\n\n\nPlease make sure you're working on the js-exercises repo Week 5 during this class.\n\nJS in the Browser\nUp until now we've been using console.log to see the results of our code running, because it allows us to focus on writing code and seeing the results instantly. But JavaScript was not meant to be run in console.log: it was meant to make web pages pages dynamic.\nLots of websites are powered by JavaScript today, and some (like Facebook) cannot function at all without it: it's become that important to the look and feel of the website.\nThe DOM\nYour webpages are made up of a bunch of HTML elements, nested within each other (parents and children). But JavaScript doesn't know about any of that.\nThankfully, in JavaScript we have access to this \"DOM\" object (Document Object Model) which is actually a representation of our webpage that JavaScript can work with.\nHere are two examples, HTML and then JavaScript, of how the DOM might look like:\n\n    \n         Welcome! \n         Hello world! \n    \n\n\nvar document = {\n    body: {\n        h1: \"Welcome\",\n        p: \"Hello world!\"\n    }\n};\n\nThe DOM offers a lot of useful functions we can use to find elements on the page. Here are some we'll be using today:\n    document.querySelector('#mainHeader');\n    document.querySelectorAll('p');\n\nBoth .querySelector and querySelectorAll accept a CSS selector as an input.\n.querySelector selects only the first element it finds, querySelectorAll selects all elements (it returns an array).\nOnce you retrieve an element using .querySelector, you can attach an event to it. An event is any action that can be performed on that element. For now, we will just use the click event:\n    var myButton = document.querySelector('#myButton');\n    myButton.addEventListener(\"click\", alertSomething);\n\n    function alertSomething() {\n        alert(\"Something\");\n    }\n\nYou will notice in the example example that we passed a second argument to addEventListener. That second argument is the function that we want to invoke when that event has happened.\nThe elements returned by document.querySelector have the same properties as a normal HTML element: for example, you can get access to their css styles.\n    var myElement = document.querySelector('#myElement');\n    myElement.style.backgroundColor = 'red';\n\nUsing the document, you can also create new elements. These elements will not appear until you append them as a child of another element though:\n    var paragraph = document.createElement('p'); // here we're just creating it, element is not visible yet\n    myElement.appendChild(paragraph); // now the element is added to our view, but it's empty\n\ndocument.createElement accepts as an input any element type. So for example document.createElement('article') will create a new article element.\nYou can then change the text displayed inside elements using the innerText property:\n    paragraph.innerText = \"How are you?\"; // now we can see the text displaying on the screen\n\nWe've been using document.querySelector to retrieve a single element.\nTo retrieve an array of multiple elements (that match a specific class name for example, or a specific tag) we use document.querySelectorAll.\n    //change the background of all the paragraph items on our page\n    var paragraphs = document.querySelectorAll('p');\n    for(var i=0; i\nWe've learned that style and innerText are properties of DOM elements. Image tags can also have width and height.\nWhile it's really easy to change styles directly on elements using the style property, it is not usually a good idea to mix JavaScript and CSS (see separation of concerns in the first lesson). To solve this, we can use the className property to set the class for an element instead of changing its styles directly:\n//before: \nvar container = document.querySelector('#myContainer');\ncontainer.className = \"largeBlock\";\n//after: \n\nTo get the text from an Input field:\nvar updateTitleBtn = document.querySelector('#updateTitleBtn');\n\nupdateTitleBtn.addEventListener('click', function() {\n    var inputBox = document.querySelector('#titleInput');\n    var title = inputBox.value;\n\n    var titleElement = document.querySelector('#lessonTitle');\n    titleElement.innerText = title;\n    inputBox.value = title;\n});\n\nThe above waits for click on a button. When the button is clicked, it gets the input box element (inputBox variable).\nTo get the entered text from it, we use the value property: var title = inputBox.value.\nAJAX\nClient/Server architecture\nA server is a device or program that provides functionality to other programs or devices. There are database servers, mail servers, game servers, etc. The vast majority of these servers are accessed over the internet. They can take the form of industrial server farms that provide a service to millions of users (used by Facebook, Google, etc.), to personal servers for storing your files.\nThe server communicates with clients. A client can be a web browser, a Slack app, your phone, etc.\nClient–server systems use the request–response model: a client sends a request to the server, which performs some action and sends a response back to the client, typically with a result or acknowledgement.\n\nHTTP Requests\nA server stores the data, and the client (other programs or computers) requests data or sends some of its own. But how do they talk to each other?\nFor the client and the server to communicate they need an established language (a protocol). Which is what HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is for. It defines the methods you can use to communicate with a server and indicate your desired actions on the resources of the server.\nThere are two main types of requests: GET and POST.\n\n\n\nRequest type\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nGET\nAsk for a specified resource (e.g. show me that photo)\n\n\nPOST\nSend content to the server (e.g. post a photo)\n\n\n\nHTTP is the language of the internet. In our case we're using Javascript, but you can send HTTP requests with other laguages as well.\nWhat is AJAX?\nAJAX is a technique for implementing client-server communication in the browser.\nTypically, the server holds the data, and only sends it to the client (web page) when there's a request. AJAX requests are sent after the page has loaded, usually in response to an action by the user. For example when the user clicks a button, some JavaScript will trigger an AJAX request to fetch data.\nIntroduction to Fetch and asynchronous code\nfetch is a way of creating HTTP requests in JavaScript.\nfetch('https://codeyourfuture.herokuapp.com/api/hello')\n    .then(function(response) {\n        return response.text(); // or response.json()\n    })\n    .then(function(text) {\n        console.log(text); // Print 'Hello CodeYourFuture!'\n    });\n\nHomework\n\nThe repo contains few challenges - solve all the pending exercises in week-5 and week-5-practise.\n\n"},"js-core-2/week-09/lesson.html":{"url":"js-core-2/week-09/lesson.html","title":"Week 9 - More JS in the Browser","keywords":"","body":"JavaScript Core II - 3\n\nMore JS in the Browser\nFork, clone and follow the instructions on the Dom-AJAX workshop repo\nHomework\nContinue the pending tasks on the Dom-AJAX workshop repo.\n"},"js-core-3/":{"url":"js-core-3/","title":"JavaScript III","keywords":"","body":"JavaScript Core 3\nExample structure:\n\n\n\nWeek\nContent\n\n\n\n\n1\nJSON  HTTP, AJAX, APIS\n\n\n2\nPromises  fetch\n\n\n3\nClasses and Object Oriented Programming\n\n\n\n"},"js-core-3/week-10/lesson.html":{"url":"js-core-3/week-10/lesson.html","title":"Week 10 - Unit Tests and TDD","keywords":"","body":"\nJS Core III - 1\nWhat will we learn today?\n\nTracing Code\nTesting\nUnit Testing\nUnit Testing Frameworks - JEST\nTest-driven Development\nMore on Testing\nTest coverage\nRefactoring\nModules\n\n\n\n\nFork and Clone the js-exercises-tdd repo\n\nTracing Code\nWhat is Code?

How do ensure it is correct. What is \"correct\" anyhow?\n\nIn many organisations, there are full teams dedicated to testing and ensuring that the code written behaves correctly, to report bugs and make sure that they are fixed on time.

The defintions for Functional, e2e and UAT are often mean different things in different teams, the responisibility for them also falls on different individuals depending on the team.\nUnit testing though is always the responsibility of the Developer, and it is a very important skill for any professional developer to be able to write tests, and also write code that is testable.\n\nDiscussion: What is testable code?\n\nvar result;\n\nfunction getMentorInfo(mentors, name) {\n    var greeting = 'Hello ';\n\n    result = mentors.find(function (person) {\n        return person.name === name;\n    });\n\n    var mentorTitle = 'Junior Developer';\n\n    if (result.yearsOfExp > 10) {\n        mentorTitle = 'Senior Developer';\n    } else if (result.yearsOfExp > 20) {\n        mentorTitle = 'Very Senior Developer';\n    }\n\n    result.jobTitle = mentorTitle;\n    result.fullName = result.title + ' ' + result.name;\n\n    return result;\n}\n\n/*\n  var mentors = [\n      {\n          name: 'Irina',\n          title: 'Dr.',\n          yearsOfExperience: 10\n      }, {\n          name: 'Ashleigh',\n          title: 'Dame',\n          yearsOfExperience: 20\n      }, {\n          name: 'Etza',\n          title: 'Professor',\n          yearsOfExperience: 30\n      }\n  ];\n\n  var result = getMentorInfo(mentors, 'Etza')\n  Trace the value of \"result\"\n*/\n\nUnit Testing\nTesting is a key skill for any software programmer. We need to make sure our\nsoftware is thoroughly tested, otherwise bad things happen. Testing makes sure\nour programs behave like we intend them to do - if we don't test, we can cause\nsevere bugs. Bad software can make planes crash, companies bankrupt, and users\nof your software really frustrated.\nThere are different levels on which we can test software, for example\nintegration testing, end-to-end testing, and unit testing. Today we will deal\nwith unit testing, which is probably the most universal testing discipline.\nA unit test is exactly that - it tests a unit of code. \"Unit\" can mean\ndifferent things, but in JavaScript it usually refers to a single function.\nRemember when we talked about functions? Functions take input (as arguments),\ndo something with it (in the function body), and return output (using the\nreturn statement). Ideally, a function should always return the same output if\nthe same input is given. It makes it predictable and testable - and that's what\nwe want!\n         |-----------------|\ninput => | doing something | => output\n         |-----------------|\nSo, when unit testing a function, we want to make sure that for a certain\ninput, we get the expected output. For this we need to make sure that the\noutput matches our expectations. In the simplest form that means we do an\nequality check:\nmyFunction(input) === expectedOutput;\n\nWe can formalise this using another function that compares two values and\ncomplains when they do not match. Such a function is prepared in\nunit-testing/equals.js.\nWe can use this function to simply compare to values:\nequals(1, 1); // This should pass\nequals(1, 2); // This should fail\nequals(\"Hello\", \"Hello\"); // This should pass\n\nNow we can use this equals() function to test our own code by comparing a\nfunction result to an expected value.\nRemember that one function can be used as an argument when a second function is called. In this instance, the function we are testing would represent our first function, and our equals() function would represent the second, like so...\nequals(myNewFunction(arg1, arg2, etc), expectedOutput)\n\nAs you can see in this example, instead of using a number as the first argument to the equals() function, we have used a function instead; the one we wish to test.\n\nExercise: Write tests for the the exercises under I.write-tests\n\nUnit testing frameworks\nThere are lots of other things you might want to test for than two things being\nequal. You might want to test if a number is smaller or greater than another, if\na function was called, if an error happened, or if one thing happened before\nanother thing, or how long a function call took to execute.\nWe don't have to build all these things ourselves. Instead there are unit\ntesting frameworks that take all that work off our shoulders. All we need to do\nis provide the code and the tests.\nJest\nThe unit testing framework we are trying to day is called\nJest. It's created by Facebook and useful\nfor all kinds of unit testing (especially testing React, which we will do in a\nlater lesson).\nLook into your jest/ folder. You will find a file there, sum.test.js. The\nsuffix .test.js tells Jest that this file contains tests it should execute. To\nexecute the test, run the following command in your terminal:\nnpm test\n\nThis command runs the test in sum.test.js, which tests the sum() function.\nYou can see the test output and the fact that the test passed.\nTests cases in Jest have the following structure:\ntest(\"test description\", function() {\n  // Test instructions\n});\n\nJest provides a set of functions that you can use to write your actual tests.\nThey are created in a way that imitates natural language, for example:\n_Expect_ sum of 1 and 2 _to be_ 3\nbecomes\nexpect(sum(1, 2)).toBe(3);\n\nYou can add multiple test statements in the same test case (a test case is one\ncall of the test function, but you can also create multiple test cases in one\nfile. It is important that you give all your test cases meaningful descriptions.\n\nExercise: Add another test case to sum.test.js. Is the sum of 10 and -10\nreally zero? Run the tests using Jest.\nExercise: Take the findNeedle function you have tested previously, copy it\ninto the jest/ folder and call it findNeedle.test.js. Then write a test to\nbe used with Jest, similar to sum.test.js. Make sure you cover multiple\ninputs and give all tests meaningful descriptions! Run the tests using Jest.\n\nTest Driven Development\nTest-driven development (TDD) is a software development process that relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle: requirements are turned into very specific test cases, then the software is improved to pass the new tests, only. This is opposed to software development that allows software to be added that is not proven to meet requirements. [Wikipedia]\nWhen developing following TDD, you normally follow this sequence:\n\nAdd a test\nRun all tests and see if the new test fails (Red)\nWrite the simplest code to make the test pass (Green)\nRefactor\nRepeat\n\nRead more on the Wikipedia article and the resources at the end.\nRed Green Refactor\n\nExercise: Two mentors pair on a problem doing \"ping pong\" TDD. One writing the test, the other writing the implementation.\n\nMore on Testing\nTest coverage\nTest coverage describes the extent to which a code base is tested. When Jest\nruns your tests, it generates a so-called coverage report. This report tells\nyou how many of your lines of code are covered by tests, how many functions,\nstatements, and branches.\n\nA branch is one of multiple ways a code control flow can go. For example, if\nyou have an if() ... else ..., both the \"if\" and the \"else\" branch must be\ncovered by tests.\n\nWe want to keep our code coverage as high as possible. Jest allows us to\ngenerate a coverage report when we run the following command in the terminal:\nnpm test -- --coverage\n\n\nExercise: Check your code coverage for the tests you wrote. Is any of the\nnumbers below 100%? If so, try and bring it up to 100%!\n\nRefactoring\nThere are times when we want to make our code better without changing any\nfunctionality, for example because we just learnt about a better way to solve a\ncertain problem (like, finding needles in haystacks). This is called\nrefactoring.\nWhen previously GREEN code - working code! - suddenly does not work anymore,\nwe call this a regression. Our existing tests can make sure that when we\nrefactor, the functionality of our code actually stays the same, and does not\nregress.\n\nExercise: Refactor some of the exercise we've written tests for.\n\nModules\nSo far, all our programs have been in their own single files. But Node programs\ncan become really large, and having all our code in only one file will not be\nmaintainable.\nWe can therefore split our code into so-called modules. A module is basically\na JavaScript file that makes its functionality available to other modules and\nprograms.\nCreating modules, exporting code\nIt is really simple to take existing JavaScript code and turn it into a module\nby exporting its functionality:\nfunction printName(name) {\n  console.log(\"My name is \" + name);\n}\n\nmodule.exports = printName;\n\nThe key here is the line containing module.exports. As you see, this is an\nassignment, and whatever is assigned to module.exports will be made available\nto other modules and program when this file is imported.\nUsing modules, importing code\nBut how do we make use of another module in our program? We need to import it,\nand this is done using a function called require().\n\nThere are different module formats for JavaScript. The one we are using here,\nwhich is natively supported by Node, is called CommonJS.\n\nvar printName = require(\"./printName.js\");\n\n\nThe string passed to the require() function is a path to the file you are\nimporting. ./ signifies the current directory, so the above command will\nimport a file called \"printName.js\" that is in the same directory as our\nprogram.\n\nAssuming our program is in the same folder as printName.js, we can use the\nabove code to import the functionality provided by that module and store it in\nthe printName variable.\nWe can then continue to use the printName function as if it we defined it in\nour own program!\nvar printName = require('./printName.js');\n\nprintName();\n\nModules can not only export functions, but all variable types you already\nlearned about. Most commonly, they export a function or an object containing\nmultiple functions.\nTogether: Edit the file modules/main.js and follow the instructions.\n\nSeparating code and tests\nExporting and importing modules is really useful for testing, too.\nAs a rule of thumb, we never want to mix our actual code with our tests. It is\ntherefore common to put them in separate files. We are going to call the file\ncontaining the tests after the file containing the code to be tested, just\nappending .test at the end of the filename. Like so:\nmain.js               # Our main program\nmain.test.js          # Tests for our main program\nsomeOtherCode.js      # A module called \"someOtherCode\"\nsomeOtherCode.test.js # Tests for the \"someOtherCode\" module\n\nThe naming is really up to convention - you can even put your tests in a\ndifferent folder! However, for Jest it is important to call test files\n\"*.test.js\".\n\nGlossary\nYou should know these terms by the end of this class: Testing, Quality Assurance, Unit Tests, Integration Tests, Refactoring, Regression Tests .. any more?\nResources\n\nJavaScript: The Good Parts by Douglas Crockford, chapter 4 - Functions\nMDN Objects basics\nMDN OOP in JS\nTest-driven development\nJest\nModules\nSetup VS Code for Debugging\n\nTracing code resources\nCheck out these videos.

Use Chrome Developer Tools to find out what is causing these issues.\nFollow this tutorial about Debugging with Chrome\nThe terms \"bug\" and \"debugging\" are popularly attributed to Admiral Grace Hopper in the 1940s.[1] While she was working on a Mark II computer at Harvard University, her associates discovered a moth stuck in a relay and thereby impeding operation, whereupon she remarked that they were \"debugging\" the system\n\nGood Design\nDesign is important if we want our code to be understandable (both to other\nhumans, but also to us in the future), to be easy to use and easy to expand.\nThere are three main principles you need to know now: clarity, reusability and\nextensibility. There are also others, but they are deeply related to these\nthree.\n\nEase of Maintenance / Clarity\n\nNaming\nCommenting\nClear logic\nConcise\nFormatting\nAvoiding Redundancy\n\n\nReusability\n\nDRY\nSingle Reponsibility\nAvoiding global state (scope)\nPredictability and Ease of testing\n\n\n\n\nExtensibility\n\nAvoiding being unnecessarily specific (e.g. magic numbers)\n\n\n\nNow let's take a look at a bigger example of a badly written function\nfunction myFunction(salary, taxCode, incomeTax1, incomeTax2, ownsCar) {\n  var totalIncomeTax = incomeTax1 + incomeTax2;\n  var studentLoan = (salary - 17775) * 0.09;\n  var originalSalary = salary;\n  var nationalInsurance = null;\n\n  if (taxCode === \"1150L\") {\n    nationalInsurance = salary * 0.1;\n  } else if (taxCode === \"ST\") {\n    nationalInsurance = salary * 0.05;\n  } else {\n    nationalInsurance = salary * 0.08;\n  }\n\n  var deductions = [nationalInsurance, totalIncomeTax, studentLoan];\n\n  salary = salary - deductions[0];\n  salary = salary - deductions[1];\n  salary = salary - deductions[2];\n\n  return (\n    \"Your gross income is £\" +\n    originalSalary.toString() +\n    \" and your net income is £\" +\n    salary.toString() +\n    \".\"\n  );\n}\n\nconsole.log(myFunction(28000, \"1150L\", 1000, 580, false));\n\nWhat is wrong with this function?\n\nNaming: the function has a bad name, myFunction() tells you nothing about\nwhat the function does. It's also considered bad practice to name variables\nvaguely by separating them through numbers (incomeTax1, incomeTax2, etc). If\nyou find yourself doing this then you should either use an array (such as\nincomeTax[]).\n\nCommenting: the function isn't documented at all. It's very difficult to\nunderstand what the function's purpose is and how each part of the code\ncontributes to it. By writing comments, the coder communicates their\nreasoning and helps the function be human readable.\n\nLayout/formatting: unnecessary spacing between the if and else statement.\n\nSingle responsibility: the function doesn't have a single purpose. It\ncalculates national insurance and salary deductions. Maybe the national\ninsurance calculation could be moved to a separate function.\n\nInput variable being overwritten: the function requires gross salary (before\ndeductions) and net salary (after deductions) the salary input variable is\ntherefore copied into an originalSalary variable so that it can be changed.\nIt would be much clearer to create a new netSalary variable and leave\nsalary unmodified.\n\nDRY principle: the function validates the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) rule.\nThe line where a deduction is taken from the salary is repeated 3 times with\ndifferent indices. This can be replaced with a for loop.\n\nMagic numbers. The code contains a lot of magic numbers, including 17775,\n0.09 and 0.1.\n\nUseless parameters: the code contains a variable which isn't used. They\nshould be removed because they are confusing. It is tempting when you're\nstarting to code a function to add more parameters thinking that you might\nneed them, but it's important to remove them if you don't end up using them.\n\n\n\nExercise: Working in pairs, go through all of these issues and make\nappropriate improvements to the code.\n\nAsync vs Sync\nToDO: Trace async code on paper\n\nDifferent ways of doing async in JavaScript\n\nIntro to ES6\nECMAScript 2015 (or ES6) is a significant update to JavaScript that introduces\nnew syntax for writing complex applications. \nconst and let\nYou have already come across the var keyword as a way to create new variables.\nThe let and const keywords are also used for variable creation, but the\nvariables created using these keywords have different scope. Var has \"function\nscope\", whereas let and const have \"block scope\".\n\nExercise: This badly designed function will throw the error message is\nnot defined. What is the problem, and how could we fix it?\n\nfunction compareNumbers(m, n) {\n  if (m \nThe const keyword is similar to let, the only difference is that a variable\ndeclared using const can't be changed after it is assigned.\n\nExercise: What advantages might a block scope variable have over a function\nscope variable? In what situation might you want to use const instead of a\nvariable that can be re-assigned?\nExercise: Let's update this code to use let and const instead of var\n\nfunction getCircleArea(radius) {\n  var pi = Math.PI;\n  var rSquared = Math.pow(radius, 2);\n\n  return pi * rSquared;\n}\n\nfunction getCircleAreas(radiusArr) {\n  var areasArr = [];\n\n  for (var i = 0; i \nTemplate literals\nWe do a lot of string concatenation in JavaScript - ES6 introduces a more\nelegant way of accomplishing the same.\nfunction greeting(name) {\n  return \"Hello \" + name + \", welcome to JS core 3!\";\n}\n\nRewriting this function in ES6, we have\nfunction greeting(name) {\n  return `Hello ${name}, welcome to JS core 3!`;\n}\n\nArrow functions\nES6 also has a new way of declaring functions. Let's see how it works.\n// before \nfunction sum(a, b, c) {\n  return a + b + c;\n}\n\n// ES6\nconst sum = (a, b, c) => {\n  return a + b + c;\n}\n\nIf the function only contains one expression, the curly braces and the return \nare optional and we can write the whole function in one line. \nconst sum = (a, b, c) => a + b + c;\n\n\nExercise: Refactor the previous code to have a separate function that checks\nif gender is 'female' or not, and use it in sayGreeting. Let's try and make\nthe code as compact as possible together using ES6 features.\n\nDefault parameters\nES6 allows us to declare defaults for function arguments. The default value is \nused when the argument/parameter is either missing or undefined. \nThis function returns the sum of three numbers. Let's assume we want to use the \nsame function with only two arguments: \n// without default parameter\nconst sum = (a, b, c) => {\n  c = c || 0;\n  return a + b + c;\n}\n\nconsole.log(sum(1, 3, 4)) // 8\nconsole.log(sum(2, 5)) // NaN\n\n// with default parameter \nconst sum = (a, b, c = 0) => {\n  return a + b + c;\n}\nconsole.log(sum(2, 5)) // 7\n\nDestructuring\nIn ES6 we can extract data from objects or arrays using destructuring. \n// before \nvar chicken = {\n  name: 'Maggie', \n  age: 2\n}\n\nvar name = chicken.name;\nvar age = chicken.age;\n\nvar numbers = [1, 2];\n\nvar firstNumber = numbers[0];\nvar secondNumber = numbers[1];\n\n\n// in ES6\nconst chicken = {\n  name: 'Maggie', \n  age: 2\n}\n\nconst { name, age } = chicken;\n\nconst numbers = [1, 2];\n\nconst [firstNumber, secondNumber] = numbers;\n\nResources\n\nES6 features\nLet and const\n\nHomework\n\nFinish the Katas in js-exercises-tdd\n\n[Optional] Clone the repo of the\nelection project and work on the tasks in the instructions.\n\nPrepare for the exam and finish all pending homework: js-exercises, js-exercises-tdd and dom-ajax\n\n\n"},"js-core-3/week-12/lesson.html":{"url":"js-core-3/week-12/lesson.html","title":"Week 12 - Recap","keywords":"","body":"\nTo Be Agreed\nJS Core III\n What we will learn today?\n\nTopic 1\nTopic 2\nTopic 3\nTopic 4\n\n\nTopic 1\nHigh level explanation of Topic 1 - rely on the exercises\n\nExercise: Always have exercises\n\nTopic 2\nTopic 3\nResources\n\nResource 1 to learn more about Topic 1\nResource 2 for Topic 2\n\nHomework\n\nFirst part of Homework - Easy\n\nSecond part of Homework - Intermediate/Hard\n\n[Bonus/Optional] Third part/optional - Hardest\n\n\nPrepare for the next class\n\nRead this Some Tutorial or Video etc...\n\n"},"node-db/":{"url":"node-db/","title":"Node/DB I","keywords":"","body":"Node\n\n\n\nWeek\nContent\nWorkshop\n\n\n\n\nweek-13\nNode, Express workshop\nExpress Workshop 1\n\n\nweek-14\nTemplating\nExpress Workshop 2\n\n\nweek-15\nNode Best Practices\nHotel workshop\n\n\n\n"},"node-db/week-13/lesson.html":{"url":"node-db/week-13/lesson.html","title":"Week 13 - Node and Express 101","keywords":"","body":"\nNode 1\nWhat we will learn today?\n\nWhat is a server?\nNode and its ecosystem\nHTTP\nExpress\nWorkshop\n\n\nWhat is a server?\nServers are computer programs that receive requests from other programs, the\nclients and send back a response e.g share data, information or hardware and\nsoftware resources.\n...and what is a server in plain English?\nA server is a computer program.

You can get more open\nsource Bootsrap-based themes from\nStartBootstrap\n\n\nExercise: Notice how the link to Contact me doesn't return a page -\nLet's add an enpoint to return a simple string this is a contact page.\n\nTemplating\nOnce you have forked the repository, let's take a look at using templates\n\nExercise: Let's change the text for the link, Contact, to Contact\nInformation.\nHow many files do you have to change? Wouldn't be nice if we could change one file and that reflects in all pages.\n\nAt the moment, we're just serving static HTML files from the public folder.\nNodeJS and ExpressJS allows us to build dynamic web pages.\n\nA server-side dynamic web page is a web page whose construction is controlled\nby an application server that processes server-side scripts. In server-side\nscripting, parameters determine how the assembly of every new web page\nproceeds, including the setting up of more client-side processing.\n\nTemplate Engines\nA template engine enables you to use static template files in your application.\nAt runtime, the template engine replaces variables in a template file with\nactual values, and transforms the template into an HTML file sent to the client.\nThis approach makes it easier to design an HTML page, as it reduces duplicate\ncode (DRY).\nSome popular template engines that work with Express are Pug, Mustache,\nand EJS.\nHandlebars Templating Engine\nWe will use Handlebars as the\ntemplating engine for this class.\nTo add it to your project: npm install --save express-handlebars\nThen in your server.js, we need to configure the middleware for Handlebars.\n// Add this to the top of your file\nconst exphbs = require(\"express-handlebars\");\n\n// Then these two lines after you initialise your express app\napp.engine(\"handlebars\", exphbs({ defaultLayout: \"main\" }));\napp.set(\"view engine\", \"handlebars\");\n\n\nLet's look at the folder views/layouts/main.handlebars\n\n\nThere is a placeholder for body where the \"body\" get injected - can you\nfind it?\nNotice the index.handlebars, my-cv.handlebars and admin.handlebars.\n\nThen add these routes:\napp.get(\"/\", (req, res) => {\n  res.render(\"index\");\n});\n\n\nExercise: Add similar endpoints for /my-cv and /admin.\nExercise: Let's create a template called contact and delete the endpoint\nwe created earlier for /contact - render a view instead - similar to what we\ndid with the previous endpoints.\nExercise: Remember how we changed Contact to Contact Information?\nTry to change now Contact Information to Get in touch. Was it any\neasier?\n\nTemplate passing info from Controller to Template\nWhen we were using the static HTML pages from public/ folder - the heading\ntext shown on top of the page (on the photo) used to change when we go to\ndifferent pages. Now that we switched to the template, we've lost that behavior\nas the code for this part comes from the centralised Layout\n(views/layouts/main.handlebars).\nHow can we imitate that behavior without having to duplicate code or serve\nstatic files? Express and Handlebars allow you to pass data between the\nroutes and the views. Here is how we can do it:\n\nLet's modify the / route to pass the title of the page.\napp.get(\"/\", (req, res) => {\n  res.render(\"index\", {\n    title: \"Etzali Profile\" // insert your name instead\n  });\n});\n\n\nIn /views/layouts/main.handlebars, let's use the data we're passing to the\ntemplate\n\n    \n        \n            \n            \n            \n            A modern Website built in Node\n        \n    \n\n\n\n\n\nExercise: Pass the subheading from the route to the view as well.\nExercise: Change Title to default to \"My Profile\" if no title was\nprovided. Look at #if helpers for Handlebars\nhttp://handlebarsjs.com/builtin_helpers.html\n\nPartials\nHandlebars allows for template reuse through partials. Partials are normal\nHandlebars templates that may be called directly by other templates.\n(Handlebars documentation)\nLet's put the Menu in a partial.\n\nGo to layout/main.handlebars and cut the  with all its contents, and\nmove it to a new file called menu.handlebars under views/partials.\n\nThen to use the partial, add {{> menu}} in the place where you cut the\noriginal menu from.\nMore Templating\nThere is much more that can be done with Handlebars templating engine. Skim\nthrough the express-handlebars\nand handlebars documentation\nFor now, we will finish by using the each helper.\nDynamically loading the templates\n{{#each posts}}\n    \n        \n            \n                {{this.title}}\n            \n            \n                {{this.summary}}\n            \n        \n    \n{{/each}}\n\nIn the route, let's load the file in data/posts.json:\napp.get(\"/\", (req, res) => {\n  const filePath = __dirname + \"/data/posts.json\";\n  const callbackFunction = (error, file) => {\n    // we call .toString() to turn the file buffer to a String\n    const fileData = file.toString();\n    // we use JSON.parse to get an object out the String\n    const postsJson = JSON.parse(fileData);\n    // send the json to the Template to render\n    res.render(\"index\", {\n      title: \"Etzali Profile\", // insert your name instead\n      posts: postsJson\n    });\n  };\n  fs.readFile(filePath, callbackFunction);\n});\n\nCallbacks\nIn JavaScript, functions are first-class objects. That means they can be used in\na first class manner like any other object since they are objects themselves. We\ncan pass them as arguments to functions which is common technique in JavaScript\nfor dealing with asynchronous behaviour. We have in fact already encountered\ncallbacks when we looked at array methods such as .forEach(), .map() and\n.filter().\nconst evenNumbers = [2, 4, 6, 8];\nevenNumbers.forEach(num => {\n  console.log(num);\n});\n\nHere we are passing the function (num) { console.log(num); } function as an\nargument to .forEach() to execute with each item in the array evenNumbers.\nThe above example is synchronous which means that code the callback is\nexecuted immediately. Let's look at an example where the code is executed\nasynchronously. We will use a setTimeout function to delay execution here.\nIn most JavaScript applications asynchronous code execution could be in response\nto an event such as mouse click or data coming back from a server. We will look\nat both of those cases in detail in a future class.\nfunction delay(callback) {\n  setTimeout(callback, 2000);\n}\n\nfunction logRandom() {\n  const value = Math.round(Math.random() * 10);\n  console.log(value);\n  return value;\n}\n\ndelay(logRandom);\n\nKey points\n\nFunctions can be passed as arguments to other other function\nFunctions that are passed as arguments are called callbacks\nCallbacks may be executed immediately or later\nIf a callback is executed later, its return value is lost\n\n\nExercise: What other Asynchronous operations have we recently used in the\nNode code we've written?\nExercise: On the CV page, there is a button, Get Repos List, that\ndoesn't work. There is code to make it work at js\\github-client.js. Add\njs\\github-client.js to your pages.\n\nThe client-side code in github-client.js should look familiar.\n\nExercise: Identify all the callbacks in this code. Refactor the\nanonymous functions to their own variables and use the variables instead.\n(Bonus point if you use arrow functions)\n\nCallback hell\nIn the code where we retrieve the repos data from Github, imagine if we had a\nrequirement, that for each repo retrieved, we have to make another API call to\nretrieve all the available branches (there is a property called branches_url\nthat we can use to get that info). And then, once we have all the branches, make\nanother API call to get the info for each branch.\nThe code to do so, will look something similar to this:\nvar oReq = new XMLHttpRequest();\noReq.addEventListener(\"load\", function() {\n  var oReq2 = new XMLHttpRequest();\n  oReq2.addEventListener(\"load\", function() {\n    var oReq3 = new XMLHttpRequest();\n    oReq2.addEventListener(\"load\", function() {\n      // 4. Now we finally have all the info we need and we can the info we retrieved from the three API calls.\n    });\n    oReq3.open(\"GET\", BRANCH_INFO_URL); // 3. third url for branch info\n    oReq3.send();\n  });\n  oReq.open(\"GET\", BRANCH_URL); // 2. second url for branches\n  oReq.send();\n});\noReq.open(\"GET\", REPO_URL); // 1. first url for Repo\noReq.send();\n\nThe code above is very hard to understand and follow. Notice the pyramid shape\n}) - This is often called the callback hell.\nAPIs\nAPIs (Application Programming Interfaces) provide a way for applications to\ncommunicate with each other. We already consumed an API earlier in the day:\nGithub API. We managed to communicate with Github and get important\ninformation. We - the client - can use this information in a number of different\nways. Our client, in this case, is a Web page but it could have easily been a\nMobile Application, or a TV setbox etc...\n\nLet's watch this video about APIs -\nWhat is an API\nExercise: Let's expose the posts.json as an API for other clients to\nconsume through the url /api/get-posts. Hint: make use res.sendFile\n\nREST API\nREST (REpresentational State Transfer) and RESTful APIs provide a convention and architecture for building APIs that is simple and scalable.\nThere are many constraints and aspects to building a REST API, but one\nfundamental constraint is the use of a URL (Uniform Resource Locator) and HTTP\nMethods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE etc..)\nIn our endpoint that we just created /api/get-posts, the get part of the\nURL is redundant as the HTTP Method GET already tells that we are GETting a\nResource. The Resource in this case is called posts.\n\nExercise: Let's rename our endpoint to /posts so that it follows RESTful\narchitecture.\nWhat would the endpoint for creating posts be called?\nWatch: What is a REST API\n(up to 3 minutes)\n\nREST is a big topic that we will revisit again. The table below from Wikipedia\nshows how a typical RESTful API would look like.\n\nWikipedia\nFor now, remember when building APIs, to use Resource names to identify your\nendpoints and make use of the HTTP methods (Verbs) to describe operations\nperformed on those resources.\nDeploying to Heroku\nHeroku is a cloud platform as a service (PaaS) that lets companies build,\ndeliver, monitor, and scale apps. Developers use Heroku to deploy, manage, and\nscale modern apps. Heroku is fully managed, giving developers the freedom to\nfocus on their core product without the distraction of maintaining servers,\nhardware, or infrastructure.\n\nSignup for an account on Heroku\nIt will send a verification to your email so make sure you've entered a\nvalid email\n\n\nDownload the Heroku CLI\nWe need to do a small tweak to our app to be ready to be deployed on Heroku.\n\nOn server.js, add the process.env.PORT bit of code\napp.listen(process.env.PORT || 3000, function() {\n  console.log(\"Server is listening on port 3000. Ready to accept requests!\");\n});\n\nThis tells our server to look for an environment variable called PORT and\nuse it to run the server, otherwise use Port 3000. When the server runs on\nheroku, then Heroku sets the PORT to the correct value.\ngit add and commit your change.\n\nNow open the command line in the folder where you have your\nexpress-workshop repo running. If you run the command git remote -v,\nyou should see one remote origin pointing to your repo.\n\nRun these commands:\nheroku login\n\nThis will ask you for your heroku email and password that you used to\nregister.\n\nOnce you're logged in:\nheroku create\n\nThe heroku create command creates a new application on Heroku – along with a\ngit remote that must be used to receive your application source.\n\nIf you check git remote -v, you should see a second remote called heroku.\nNow push your code to heroku git push heroku master. The push will run few\ncommands from Heroku, then you should see a url similar to\nhttps://some-random-name-XXXX.herokuapp.com - go to the URL and if all goes\nwell, your app should be up and running.\nTo read more about Heroku and deploying Node Apps to Heroku, check:\n\nDeploying with Git\nGetting Started on Heroku with Node.js\n\nHomework\n\nDeploy to Heroku if you haven't yet\nAdd a route posts/:postid that displays a specific post - Read about route\nparameters on\nExpress documentation\nWhen the user clicks on a route in the home page, navigate them to your\nroute.\nAmend your JSON structure to have a postId that you can use it to\nidentify which post we want to display.\n\n\nImplement the Admin page.\nWrite a posts endpoint that you can hit and that should save to the JSON\nfile (use the helper functions we added under helpers/savePost)\nMake an AJAX call from the front end (the admin page) to your new\nendpoint.\nYou might need to use formidable or body-parser middleware to get the\ndata on the server.\n\n\nConsume a posts API built by another colleague (and deployed to Heroku) to\ndisplay their latest blog posts. You can display the posts on any page that\nyou see suitable (or add a new page).\nSecure the Admin page so that it's only visible if a certain query parameter\nis provided\nCan you go a bit further with adding proper security?

This is fine and works well for some data - particularly simple data -\nbut it can quickly cause issues with your data.\nTEACHER STORY:\nBack in 2013 I used to work for a company that ran hotel wifi systems for five star hotels.\nWe did Intercontinentals, Sheratons, Marriotts and a whole bunch of others. This company had been\ngoing for a long time and hails back to the times when wifi used to be very expensive.\nThe code for this system had the notion of \"invoices\", \"wifi enrollments\" and \"guests\" and\nstored data on each. We would store data on each and we would run reports on each and send them\nto the hotels who would use them to bill guests.\nAll fine so far. Except we would sometimes send reports with invoices which didn't have enrollments,\nenrollments which didn't have guests. Sometimes the amounts on those invoices would rack up to\ntens even hundreds of thousands of dollars. Of invoices without customers.\nThis was how the face of the hotel manager looked:\n\nThis was a very, very serious problem. We were >.\nThis was a problem because our system was buggy, so we had what are generally called \"data integrity\"\nissues. Data integrity issues are like normal bugs except much, much worse. You can almost always fix\na normal bug. For bad data the chances are you will never fix it.\nThese lessons are about storing and retrieving data safely such that you won't have the same problems\nI did.\nLESSON 1B : What is the point of an SQL database?\nWe're going to teach you a new programming language. It's called SQL. Pronounced \"S - Q - L\" or sequel, either is fine.\nDatabases are simply programs that take data and stuff it in files just like you were doing in the previous lesson.\nHowever, the way we use a database is different to the way we store things in files. In a file, you can put any random jumble of data in and get it out again. How you put it in and get it out is up to you. Your code needs to open the file, close the file, retrieve, store or modify and validate everything itself. Offloading some of that responsibility to another program means that your code can achieve all the same things but be simpler.\nYou interact with almost all of them using the same programming language which is called \"SQL\". It's been around for 31 years and is still completely dominant. Computing moves fast, but SQL doesn't change. This kind of lesson will probably still be taught in 50 years. Probably 4 out of 5 software jobs involve SQL In some way.\nSQL is a different, and usually simpler kind of programming language that you use with a database (sometimes called an RDBMS) to:\n\nStore data in a way such that its structure cannot be violated.\n\nRetrieve data (get me all the reservations under the name \"Trump\") and answer questions about data (\"what was the sum total of all of the invoices in february?\").\n\n\nAn RDBMS (relational database management system) will do this by, for example:\n\nData constraints (e.g. each reservation must have a customer)\nData types (e.g. check in date can only be a date)\nUniqueness of certain pieces of data (e.g. there is only one person with the driver's license ID 941413).\nOrganizing how the data is retrieved and assembled (e.g. fetch me all reservations under customer \"Donald Trump\").\nExecutes on a different process/machine, meaning that the queries can be parallelized, and work can be offloaded from the main server.\n\nEXERCISE 1B: INSTALLING SQLITE ON YOUR LAPTOP AND CREATING YOUR FIRST DATABASE\nThe RDBMS we are going to teach you first is called \"sqlite\". It's pretty much the industry standard for creating small, self contained database that fit in one file - quite a common task.\n\nWindows: https://sqlite.org/download.html\nUbuntu: apt-get install sqlite\nMac OS: brew install sqlite\n\nTo run SQLite, open a command prompt and run \"sqlite mydatabase.sqlite\".\nThis should give you a prompt like this:\nSQLite version 2.8.17\nEnter \".help\" for instructions\nsqlite>\n\nThis is a command prompt where you can run snippets of SQL and load files containing SQL.\nLESSON 1C: CREATING A TABLE\nThe first thing we want to store is customers, since without customers, you don't have a hotel.\nFirst, open a file in any text editor and put the following in a file called 'hotel.sql':\ncreate table customers (\n    title varchar,\n    firstname varchar,\n    surname varchar\n);\n\ninsert into customers (title, firstname, surname) values ('Mr', 'Donald', 'Trump');\n\nWhat we have here:\n\nCreating a table - this creates the structure which you can use to put data in. The items are columns.\nInsert into - puts data into that structure.\nSelect * from - gets the entire contents of that table.\n\n'title varchar' - this means we're creating a column with the name 'title' which holds a 'variable number of characters'. This is pretty much the same thing as a string in javascript.\n\n\nNow, in the command prompt run the following:\n$ sqlite mydatabase.sqlite\n\nsqlite> .read hotel.sql\nNow that the file has been loaded with one table containing one row of data, you can read it back\nout again like this:\nWhat to put on the right hand side (data retrieval):\nsqlite> select * from customers;\n\nNow that you've done all that, DELETE the mydatabase.sqlite file, run it again and make sure you get the same result again.\nEXERCISE 1C: Create tables and insert data\n\nAmend hotel.sql create the database again and add yourselves as second customer using INSERT - so you're now staying in a hotel with Donald Trump. Run select * and ensure that you see yourself both as guests. Then delete mydatabase.sqlite again.\n\nChange hotel.sql again to store email addresses from yourself and Donald (donald.trump@whitehouse.gov) and have them displayed on screen. Run select * and ensure you are both guests. Then delete mydatabase.sqlite again.\n\nChange hotel.sql again. Add teacher - \"Colm OConner\" - as your third customer. My email address is \"colm.oconner.github@gmail.com\".\n\n\nLESSON 1D: Data types\ncreate table invoices (\n    reservation_id      integer,\n    total               number,\n    invoice_date_time   datetime not null,\n    paid                boolean default false\n);\n\ninsert into invoices (reservation_id, total, invoice_date_time, paid) values (123, 3444.50, '01/01/2017', 1);\n\ninsert into invoices (reservation_id, total, invoice_date_time) values (124, 3445.50, '02/01/2017');\n\nAnd in the command box:\nsqlite>  select * from invoices\n\nWhat we have here:\n\nAn 'integer', a 'number', a 'datetime' and a boolean. These are all analogous to data types which you have learned about in javascript but there are sometimes subtle differences that you will eventually run in to.\n\nFor \"paid\" which is either yes or no - we have a default of 'no' - it's saying that if you insert data and don't specify 'paid' as a column when you INSERT data, it will assume you meant 'no'.\n\nFor 'invoice_date_time' you must store the data in the form of a combination of date and time. It has a 'not null' constraint which means that you have to give a datetime when you insert data, it will refuse to let you insert an invoice without specifying invoice_date_time and refuse to let you explicitly give your invoice_date_time as null.\n\n\nFurther reading : https://www.sqlite.org/datatype3.html\n\nEXERCISE 1D : Data types\nIn your \"hotel.sql\" create a reservations table with columns for customer ID, room ID, check in date, check out date and price per night and insert a bunch of example data - maybe you and 10 friends or celebrities.\nThe hotel manager has told you:\n\nCustomers do have to give a check in date, but they don't have to give a check out date.\nReservations need a customer ID and a room ID\nReservations have a check in date, a check out date and a price per night.\n\nLESSON 1E : SELECT\nCurrently we've just put data in to a table and gotten all of it out. What about if we only want specific data?\nFor this we will introduce a SQL key word called 'WHERE'.\nLets go back to the invoices table. Make your SQL files have a create table for invoices in like this:\ncreate table invoices (\n    reservation_id      integer,\n    total               number,\n    invoice_date_time   datetime not null,\n    paid                boolean default false\n);\n\nAnd put in a bunch of data like this:\ninsert into invoices (reservation_id, total, invoice_date_time, paid) values (123, 143.50, '01/01/2017', 1);\n\ninsert into invoices (reservation_id, total, invoice_date_time) values (124, 250.50, '02/01/2017');\n\ninsert into invoices (reservation_id, total, invoice_date_time) values (150, 431.50, '03/01/2017');\n\ninsert into invoices (reservation_id, total, invoice_date_time) values (155, 300.50, '04/01/2017', 1);\n\ninsert into invoices (reservation_id, total, invoice_date_time) values (156, 284.35, '04/01/2017', 1);\n\nSo, if you do a regular query you just get all of the data:\nselect * from invoices\n\nIf you do \nselect * from invoices where reservation_id = 123;\n\nselect * from invoices where invoice_date_time \nEXERCISE 1F : SELECT\nWrite SQL for the following:\n\nWhich invoices were paid?\n\nWhich invoices were for under 300 pounds?\n\nWhich invoices paid on 3rd January 2017 or after?\n\n\nLESSON 1G : Primary Keys\nOk, now we're going to introduce a problem. Let's say a secretary types in a bunch of invoice IDs and values:\ncreate table invoices (\n    reservation_id      integer,\n    total               number,\n    invoice_date_time   datetime not null,\n    paid                boolean default false\n);\n\ninsert into invoices (reservation_id, total, invoice_date_time, paid) values (123, 143.50, '01/01/2017');\n\ninsert into invoices (reservation_id, total, invoice_date_time) values (123, 250.50, '02/01/2017');\n\nselect * from invoices;\n\nQUESTION FOR CLASS : What is the problem here? [ A business calls up and says they need to pay invoice 123 ]\nWe solve this problem with something called a \"primary key\" - what this does is make it so the database will absolutely refuse to accept a number if you enter in a duplicate.\ncreate table invoices (\n    reservation_id      integer primary key,\n    total               number,\n    invoice_date_time   datetime not null,\n    paid                boolean default false\n);\n\ninsert into invoices (reservation_id, total, invoice_date_time, paid) values (123, 143.50, '01/01/2017');\n\nTry entering an invoice with ID 123 now:\nsqlite> insert into invoices (reservation_id, total, invoice_date_time) values (123, 250.50, '02/01/2017');\ncreate table invoices (\n    reservation_id      integer primary key,\n    total               number,\n    invoice_date_time   datetime not null,\n    paid                boolean default false\n);\n\ninsert into invoices (reservation_id, total, invoice_date_time, paid) values (123, 143.50, '01/01/2017', 1);\n\ninsert into invoices (reservation_id, total, invoice_date_time) values (124, 250.50, '02/01/2017');\n\ninsert into invoices (reservation_id, total, invoice_date_time) values (999, 250.50, '03/01/2017');\n\nNow, picking primary keys is a tricky problem. You need to make sure that you pick some kind of\nidentifier which you know will always be unique.\nQUESTION FOR CLASS:\n\nIs first name a good candidate for a primary key?\nIs first name and surname together a good candidate for a primary key?\nIs a driver's license ID a good candidate for a primary key? [ if and only if everybody is from the same country ]\nIs a passport ID a good candidate for a primary key? [ if and only if everybody is from europe ]\nIs just coming up with an arbitrary number that is unique a good candidate for a primary key?\n\nLESSON 1H: AUTOINCREMENTING PRIMARY KEYS\nWe still have a problem here. Joe the office manager who is entering invoices doesn't really want to \nkeep coming up with random numbers every time he enters an invoice. Why not just get the database to give\nus an ID?\nWe can do that with a magic feature called autoincrementing numbers. You don't specify the ID and the\ndatabase will just give your row a new ID. What ID will it give it? The ID of the last row plus one.\ncreate table invoices (\n    reservation_id      integer primary key autoincrement,\n    total               number,\n    invoice_date_time   datetime not null,\n    paid                boolean default false\n);\n\ninsert into invoices (total, invoice_date_time, paid) values (143.50, '01/01/2017', 1);\n\ninsert into invoices (total, invoice_date_time) values (250.50, '02/01/2017');\n\nNOTE: the word 'autoincrement' and the lack of ID specified in the insert statement.\nEXERCISE 1H : Primary Keys\n\nRecreate customer table with a primary key. Bear in mind that you don't have a driver's license or passport ID.\n\nRecreate reservations table with a primary key.\n\n\nLESSON 1I : Foreign keys\nNow, as we've seen two tables that have an intrinsic relationship to one another. Every invoice has\na reservation ID.\ncreate table reservations (\n  `id`                    integer primary key autoincrement,\n  `customer_id`           integer,\n  `room_id`               integer,\n  `check_in_date`         datetime not null,\n  `checkout_out_date`,    datetime,\n  `room_price_per_night`  real\n);\n\ncreate table invoices (\n    id                  integer primary key autoincrement,\n    reservation_id      integer,\n    total               number,\n    invoice_date_time   datetime not null,\n    paid                boolean default false\n);\n\ninsert into reservations (customer_id, room_id, check_in_date, check_out_date, room_price_per_night) values (123, 55, '01/01/2017', '02/01/2017', 100);\n\ninsert into reservations (customer_id, room_id, check_in_date, check_out_date, room_price_per_night) values (124, 55, '03/01/2017', '05/01/2017', 100);\n\ninsert into invoices (reservation_id, total, invoice_date_time, paid) values (123, 100, '03/01/2017', 1);\n\ninsert into invoices (reservation_id, total, invoice_date_time) values (124, 50, '06/01/2017', 0);\n\ninsert into invoices (reservation_id, total, invoice_date_time) values (124, 50, '06/01/2017', 1);\n\nPoint out that the reservation ID corresponds with the ID on the reservations table.\nsqlite> insert into invoices (reservation_id, total, invoice_date_time) values (125, 50, '06/01/2017);\n\nQUESTION FOR CLASS: What's the problem with the last statement? \nA: Invoice isn't going to get paid because we don't know who it's for.\nTo fix this problem we place an additional restriction on the data - you can only add IDs that exist to columns referencing other tables.\n\ncreate table reservations (\n  `id`                    integer primary key autoincrement,\n  `customer_id`           integer,\n  `room_id`               integer,\n  `check_in_date`         datetime not null,\n  `checkout_out_date`,    datetime,\n  `room_price_per_night`  real\n);\n\ncreate table invoices (\n    id                           integer primary key autoincrement,\n    foreign key(reservation_id)  references reservations(reservation_id),\n    total                        number,\n    invoice_date_time            datetime not null,\n    paid                         boolean default false\n);\n\nEXERCISE 1I : Foreign keys\n\nChange the file to insert the data from above without IDs.\n\nChange the file to add foreign key relationship for reservations table and customers table.\n\n\nLESSON 1J : Updating data\nLet's say that we made a mistake with one of the invoices created above.\nFirst get the ID of an invoice entered earlier:\nsqlite> select * from invoices where invoice_date_time = '01/01/2017';\n\nIf you want to change this invoice to be £300, you need to use 'UPDATE'.\nsqlite> update invoices where id = [ ID FROM ABOVE ] set room_price_per_night = 300.0;\n\nEXERCISE 1J : Updating data\n\nRun SQL from lesson 1C where my surname was entered as OConner.

This is just another yet another one, that we will be connecting to a database.\nIn order for us to interact with the server, we are going to use Postman, which will accurately mimic API calls made from react. In the last three lessons you're going to make react do to this back end what postman is going to do today.\nWe're going to use it for debugging. Can anybody tell me what debugging is?\n\n\nTask Download and install Postman.\nNow let us all try Postman by GETting from http://localhost:8080/api/customers, as is shown next.\n\nLESSON 1: SELECT ALL THE THINGS!\nUser Story: As a staff member, I want to be able to view a list of customers so that I can see who has visited our hotel.\nUse case When a user does a GET request to /customers it should return customer titles, first names, surnames.\nUser acceptance test: Do a GET request and get back [{\"title\": \"mr\", \"firstname\": \"Donald\", \"surname\": \"Trump\"}, {\"title\": \"Mrs\", \"firstname\": \"Hillary\", \"surname\": \"Clinton\"}]\nRemove the code that is returning a JSON object on end point /customers, and use what you have learned about to SQL to fill in the query that fetches all the customers from the database.\nYou will need to install a package to deal with sqlite npm install --save sqlite3 then add this code before the routes in class2.js\n// Add these lines before the routes definition\nconst filename = './database/database.sqlite'\nconst knex = require('knex')({\n  client: 'sqlite3',\n  connection: {\n    filename\n  }\n})\n\n\nselect everything\n\n\n// This is the route we will need to update\nrouter.get('/customers', function(req, res) {\n  res.status(200).json({\n    customers: [{\n      id: 2,\n      title: 'Mr',\n      firstname: 'Laurie',\n      surname: 'Ainley',\n      email: 'laurie@ainley.com'\n    }\n  ]});\n})\n\nWho can tell me what this is currently doing? What do we need to make it do?\nSo, the answer is here:\nconst sqlStatement = 'select * from customers';\nknex.raw(sqlStatement).then(function (data) {\n  res.json(data);\n});\n\nThis is the library we will use for building queries. Knex provides helpers for creating queries so we normally won't use knex.raw in real applications, but we will use it today to practice SQL more, and write \"raw\" SQL statements.\nExercise 1\nUser Story: As a staff member I need to check the details of a given customer given its id.\nUser Acceptance test: Complete the end-point /customers/:id, so that it extracts that customer information from the database, and replies back with that information as JSON.\n\nselect and filter by id\nhint: simple select and filter by ID\n\nSTRETCH GOAL (OPTIONAL) : If you get a request of /customers/notanumber (anything that isn't a number) it should return an HTTP 400 bad request.\nLESSON 2 : LIKE, WHATEVER\nSo, now we're going to deal with one of the most common issues with hotel databases: the guest's name being misspelled.\nSo, \"Hilary Clinten\" is added to the database. She calls up on the phone asking about her reservation and spells her name correctly on the phone. The hotel staff knows what some of her name sounds like but not all of it and they want to find her as a customer on the system.\nFor this problem where we want to search in part of a string we use the LIKE command:\nselect * from customers where surname like '%lint%';\n\nThis returns all of the customers who have the name 'lint' in their names.\nselect * from customers where surname like '%clint%';\n\nThis won't return anything at all. Why not?\nselect * from customers where surname ilike '%clint%';\n\nThis will. Why?\nEXERCISE 2A\nUser Story: As a staff member I want to search for a customer through its surname, but we don't know that it might be misspelled.\nUser Acceptance test: Complete the end-point /customers/:surname, so that it extracts that customer information from the database, and replies back with that information as JSON.\n\nselect and filter through like\n\nEXERCISE 3\nUser Story: As a guest, I want to register my details in the system so that I can check availability for my stay.\nUser Acceptance test: Take the data being POSTed to the /customers endpoint check it is inserted into the database.\nSTRETCH GOAL (OPTIONAL): If a bad request is made to customers - first name is missing, for instance, return an HTTP 400 Bad reqest.\nHOMEWORK 4\nNotes on Postman\nIn the next image you can see Postman doing a POST request. Highlighed areas indicate the fields that need to be changed and/or information that needs to be added. The arrow points to a tab where you will need to set the type of content of this request. As denoted by the arrow legend, you will need to set Content-Type to application/json.\n\nUser Story: As a guest, I noticed that there is a typo on my details and wish to correct it.\nUse Case: I go to '/customers/:id' endpoint and send updated data for each customer parameter: title, firstname, surname.\nUser acceptance test: PUT title=mr, firstname=donald, surname=trump on /customers/:id and check that the database was updated.\n\nupdate table\nremember your previous lesson\nhint: in the javascript code, instead of db.all() you will need ... what?\n\nHOMEWORK 4 : STRETCH GOAL (OPTIONAL)\nThe end point should properly detect which customer properties are being updated, and generate the appropriate SQL update statement.\nHOMEWORK 5\nUser Story: As a staff member, I want to create a new reservation.\nCreate and end-point to post a new reservation to /reservations/.\n\ninsert into\ncreate the endpoint from scratch\nwhich HTTP method should you use?\n\nSTRETCH GOAL (OPTIONAL) : Return {\"status\": \"error\": \"reason\": \"reason...\"} if anything was wrong with the request.\nLESSON 6 : I WISH I COULD DELETE HIM IN REAL LIFE\nWe've currently done inserting data and updating data, but sometimes inserting data was just a mistake\nand it needs to go.\nIt's a fairly simple command that looks like select, you just specify the table and a predicate and it wipes:\ndelete from customers where surname ilike '%trump%';\n\nThere are several things you need to worry about when you delete data and what you do about them will depend entirely upon what it is you are trying to do:\n\nWhat happens to the data that depends upon the data you deleted?\n-- What if Trump had a reservation? Either a) delete the reservation as well? or b) raise an error and force the user to delete the data manually if they really want him gone.\n\nWhat if you want to undo the deletion?\n\nWhat if you want to mark some data as deleted but you might still want to refer to it?\n\nOften it's a good idea to give data the 'status' deleted instead of actually deleting it.\n\n\nHOMEWORK 6\nUser Story: As a staff member, I want to delete a canceled reservation from the database.\nNotes on Postman\nThe delete request is actually pretty straight forward. We only need to select the type and provide the url:\n\nCreate an end-point to delete a given reservation from /reservation/:id/.\n\ndelete\n\nHOMEWORK 7\nUser Story: As a staff member, I want to get a list of all the existing reservations.\nCreate an end-point to get from /reservations all existing reservations.\n\ncreate the endpoint from scratch\n\nHOMEWORK 8\nUser Story: As a customer, I want to check the details of a reservation.\nCreate and end-point to get from /reservations/:id the details of a resrevation through its id.\n\nsimple filtering\ncreate the enpoint from scratch\n\nHOMEWORK 9\nUser Story: As a staff member, I want to get a list of all the reservations that start at a given date.\nCreate and end-point to get from /reservations/starting-on/:startDate all the reservations that start at a given date.\n\nsimple filtering\ncreate the enpoint from scratch\n\nHOMEWORK 10\nUser Story: As a staff member, i want to get a list of all the reservations that are active at a given date.\nCreate and end-point to get from /reservations/active-on/:date all the reservations that are active on a given date - some customer has a room reserved on that day.\n\nmultiple filtering.\ncreate the enpoint from scratch\n\n"},"node-db/week-18/lesson.html":{"url":"node-db/week-18/lesson.html","title":"Week 18 - Data Integrity & Analytics","keywords":"","body":"LESSON 3: DATA INTEGRITY AND ANALYTICS\nWhat we will learn today?\n\nHow to add invalid relational data to a database\nHow to prevent invalid relational data with foreign keys\nDatabase nulls\nPredicates\nCombining SQL predicates with AND and OR\nSQL - Order by\nSQL - Count / Sum / Avg\nSQL - Group by\nSQL - HAVING\nSQL - LIMIT\nSQL - like\nSQL - DISTINCT\nSQL - 'IN'\n\nLESSON 7 : JOIN ME, AND TOGETHER WE CAN RULE THE INTERNET AS FATHER AND SON!\nNow let's say we want to get the names of customers who have a reservation today.\nFrom what we know now, we could do it like this:\n\nselect customer_id from reservations where date_started = '01/01/2018'\nwrite down the list of customer ids on paper (e.g. 3, 5, 7)\nselect * from customers where id = 3 or id = 5 or id = 7\n\nHowever, that's stupid.

It is used for making complex, interactive user interfaces. It has become very popular in the last 5 years.\nWhy has it become so popular?\n\nIt is fast and efficient\nIt is easy to understand & less verbose than \"vanilla\" JS api\nIt helps separate functionality into small, understandable pieces\n\nWhat is a component?\nReact heavily relies on a concept called \"components\". Components are like small Lego blocks for designing and developing user interfaces. They can be stuck together in different ways to create new UI.\nLet's have a look at an example: the GitHub header. What are logical \"pieces\" of UI? What could be a component?\n\nHere we've highlighted some elements that could be components:\n\nComponent tips\nThere are no hard & fast rules for making components. UIs can be split up into components in many different ways, requiring judgement based on your context.\n\nComponents should follow the Single Responsibility Principle\nEach component should only have 1 \"responsibility\"\nShould only do 1 thing\n\n\nComponents should have good, explicit names\nThis helps you to remember what the component's job is\n\n\n\n\nExercise:\nLook at the example online shopping user interface in the Thinking in React article (the image at the top). Draw boxes around the components and give them names. Compare with the example components shown in the second image.\n\nRendering with React\nRemember how annoying it was to manage the DOM yourself in week 8? The \"vanilla\" JavaScript apis for updating the DOM are quite long and difficult to remember. React makes this easier by instead of manipulating each DOM element itself. You give React a \"description\" of the DOM that you want and it will  update the DOM for you. React \"abstracts\" away the management of the DOM.\nLet's take a look at an example. We are going to walk through how to render a  with the text \"Hello World\" within it.\nFirst, lets recap how we could do this using \"vanilla\" JS (interactive version):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    var divNode = document.createElement('div');\n    var textNode = document.createTextNode('Hello World');\n    divNode.appendChild(textNode);\n\n    var rootElement = document.getElementById('root');\n    rootElement.appendChild(divNode);\n\n\n\n\nNow let's convert to using React (interactive version):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    const element = React.createElement('div', {\n        children: 'Hello World'\n    })\n\n    const rootElement = document.getElementById('root')\n    ReactDOM.render(element, rootElement)\n\n\n\n\nJSX\nAs you can see, React is already helping us a bit by cleaning up some of the verbose vanilla JS APIs. However in a typical React application you would still use a lot of the React.createElement function. To improve the developer experience the React team developed JSX.\nJSX is a simple syntax \"sugar\" that looks like HTML, but is actually converted to the React.createElement function when you run it.\nUsing JSX (interactive version):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    const element = Hello World\n\n    const rootElement = document.getElementById('root')\n    ReactDOM.render(element, rootElement)\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see, this is much easier to read than both the straight React.createElement API and the vanilla JS API. Most people using React use JSX to write their components.\n\nExercises\n\nChange the JSX example from above to instead render a h1 with an id of \"main-header\" and the text \"Hello Ali\"\nVisit the Babel REPL and copy/paste the h1 that you just created\n\n\nLet's Create A React App\nThe Facebook team behind React have created a tool to help you create and set up React projects. It is called Create React App. We will use it for the rest of the module.\n\nExercise: Install & set up a Create React App by following the steps below\n\nnpm install -g create-react-app\n\ncreate-react-app my-hotel\ncd my-hotel/\nnpm start\nNotice that create-react-app has created a bunch of folders for you in the my-hotel directory.\nReact Components\nWe looked at the beginning of the lesson at the concept of components. Now let's look at how components are made in React.\nimport React from 'react'\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom'\n\nclass HelloWorld extends React.Component {\n    render() {\n        return Hello World\n    }\n}\n\nReactDOM.render(, document.getElementById('root'))\n\nComponents get more powerful when you combine (or \"compose\") several components together (interactive example):\nclass Greeting extends React.Component {\n    render() {\n        return Hello\n    }\n}\nclass Mentor extends React.Component {\n    render() {\n        return Ali\n    }\n}\n\nclass HelloWorld extends React.Component {\n    render() {\n        return (\n            \n                \n                \n            \n        )\n    }\n}\n\nNotice how the components that we write (HelloWorld, Greeting, Mentor) are camelCased and always start with an uppercase letter? And \"regular DOM\" components (div, span) are always lowercase? This the convention to let you know whether you are using a \"regular DOM component\" or something that you have written.\nEmbedding JS into JSX\nLike Handlebars, you can insert variables (and some other things) into React components. Anything that is inside curly braces ({ and }) is interpreted as a regular JavaScript \"expression\". That means you can use every object or function from JavaScript that we have learned so far. Let's look at an example (interactive example):\nclass Mentor extends React.Component {\n    render() {\n        const mentors = ['Ali', 'Kash', 'Davide', 'German', 'Gerald']\n        return {mentors.join(', ')}\n    }\n}\n\nNow we have modified the Mentor component to use the Array.join method so that it lists several mentor's names. This also works with other JS types:\n{1 + 2 + 3}\n\nconst weather = {\n    temperature: 5,\n    location: 'London'\n}\nThe temperature in {weather.location} is {weather.temperature}\n\nfunction formatName(user) {\n    return user.firstName + ' ' + user.lastName\n}\n{formatName(user)}\n\nA common pattern in React is to use Array.map to loop through a list of items and render a component for each one (interactive example):\nconst mentors = ['Ali', 'Kash', 'Davide', 'German', 'Gerald']\n\nclass Item extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      {this.props.name}\n    )\n  }\n}\n\nclass List extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \n        {this.props.items.map((item) => (\n          \n        ))}\n      \n    );\n  }\n}\n\nHere we are using Array.map to turn an array of strings into an array of components. We are using a \"real\" map function, not just special syntax like {{> each}} from Handlebars.\nAn (interactive example) of separating the 2 components in the example above in 2 files.\n\nExercise:\nUsing the my-hotel React app that you created earlier, edit src/App.js to create a hotel welcome page.\n\nChange the title to say \"Welcome to CYF Hotel\" and change the img to have src=\"https://codeyourfuture.io/static/media/cyf_brand.fbcea877.png\"\nCopy the content of the header to a new component called Logo\nReplace the header with a usage of the new Logo component\nReplace the p with a message saying that there are bookings available for today's date (hint new Date().toLocaleDateString())\nExtract the p to a component named BookingsMessage\nCreate a new component SpecialDeals and render an empty div\nWithin the SpecialDeals components, use an array containing some special deal strings and render each one as a  within the div\n\n\nImporting/Exporting Components\nTo help organise your code, components can be imported and exported just like any other JavaScript code (interactive example):\nimport Greeting from './Greeting'\nimport Mentor from './Mentor'\n\nclass HelloMentor extends React.Component {\n    render() {\n        return (\n            \n                \n                \n            \n        )\n    }\n}\n\n\nExercise:\nUsing the my-hotel app, edit src/App.js to extract the Logo, BookingsMessage and SpecialDeals components to new files src/Logo.js and src/SpecialDeals.js\nHint: you will need to import React\n\nCredits\nInspiration & examples for this module were taken from Kent C.

Hint: imagine what a user story might look like for this small application. How might changes to the user story affect changes to the code?\nOur components are very inflexible. They cannot say hello to other mentors, and they can only say \"hello\", not \"hi\" or \"greetings\". If our user stories change, for example if we wanted to say hello to a different mentor, we would have to to change the code too. This is easy in our tiny application but for \"real\" applications this might be more difficult.\nInstead wouldn't it be good if we could change which mentor we are saying hello to every time we render the component? This is what \"props\" are for.\nWhat Are Props?\nProps are what we use in React to pass \"arguments\" to components. They are very similar to arguments in functions - you can \"pass\" props to components, and you can use those props in a component.\nFirst let's look at passing props to your components (interactive example):\n\n\nAs you can see props are key-value pairs, in this example the key is mentor and the value is the string 'Kash'. We don't have to use strings, we can use any valid JavaScript data like numbers, arrays and objects. Remember that in JSX you can use curly braces ({ & }) to inject data that is not a string:\n\n\nNow let's take a look at using props that we have passed to a component (interactive example):\n{this.props.mentor}\n\nReact gives you access to props via the this.props object. We can then inject into our component using curly braces. Because this.props is just a regular object, you can also inject into DOM attributes:\n{this.props.content}\n\n\nExercise:\nOpen the my-hotel React application that your created last week\n\nEdit the Logo component so that the hotel name in the welcome message is passed as a prop\nEdit the SpecialDeals component so that the array is passed as a prop\n\n\nReacting to Changes\nNow let's write a more interesting app that responds to some user input. We'll see how React will take care of updating the DOM for you.\nA counter is a common React example, showing the number of times a button has been clicked. First lets render a button and a counter which set to 0 clicks (interactive example):\nlet count = 0\n\nclass Counter extends React.Component {\n    render() {\n        return (\n            \n                Count: {this.props.count}\n                Click me!\n            \n        )\n    }\n}\nfunction renderCounter() {\n    ReactDOM.render(, document.getElementById('root'))\n}\n\nrenderCounter(count)\n\nNote that this example is simplified compared to your my-hotel application, because some parts are split into separate files to keep the code clean. You'll find the ReactDOM.render call in index.js\nThis example isn't very useful yet as it doesn't do anything when clicking the button. Now let's listen for clicks on the button and increment the counter (interactive version):\nlet count = 0\n\nclass Counter extends React.Component {\n    // ...\n}\nfunction renderCounter(count) {\n    // ...\n}\n\nrenderCounter(count)\n\ndocument.getElementById('click-me').addEventListener('click', () => {\n    count = count + 1\n    renderCounter(count)\n})\n\nAs you can see, the DOM automatically updates when you render. This is an incredibly powerful feature of React. Even better, React will figure out exactly the right bits of the DOM that need to be changed. This makes it extremely efficient and fast. This is concept is called the \"virtual DOM\".\nState\nLet's take another look at the the counter example. A new user story has been created to show multiple counters. How would you add another counter?\nYou could add some more count global variables:\nlet count1 = 0\nlet count2 = 0\nlet count3 = 0\n\nWhat might be the problem here?\n\nIt's quite verbose\nIt's hard to make sure that you're updating the correct counter\nIt's stuck at 3 counters - to add more, a new user story would have to be created\n\nWhat other approaches can we take?\nThe solution that React provides for us is called \"state\". It allows a component to \"remember\" some variables. Let's take a look at how we could rewrite the counter with React state.\nFirst we'll get rid of the global variables. Generally having global variables is a bad idea, since it is very easy to create a bug which affects the whole application. We can also get rid of the renderCounter function and just call ReactDOM.render directly:\nReactDOM.render(, document.getElementById('root'))\n\nNext we'll change the component to use the count from this.state instead of this.props:\nclass Counter extends Component {\n    render() {\n        return (\n            \n                Count: {this.state.count}\n                Click me!\n            \n        )\n    }\n}\n\nThis code has a bug! this.state is initialised as an empty object, and so this.state.count is undefined. We need to initialise it from props. We can do this in the class constructor:\nclass Counter extends Component {\n    constructor(props) {\n        this.state = {\n            count: props.count\n        }\n    }\n\n    render() {\n        // ...\n    }\n}\n\nThis is a common pattern in React. Props often act like \"initial configuration\" for a component which are copied to state. If state doesn't need to be configured through props, you can set it's initial value here too.\nNow the counter component is \"remembering\" that it's count, however it is stuck at 0. Next we'll look at how we change what the component is remembering (interactive example):\nclass Counter extends Component {\n    constructor(props) {\n        // ...\n    }\n\n    increment = () => {\n        let currentCount = this.state.count\n        this.setState({\n            count: ++currentCount\n        })\n    }\n\n    render() {\n        return (\n            \n                Count: {this.state.count}\n                Click me!\n            \n        )\n    }\n}\n\nThere's a couple of things happening here. We've added an click handler to the button, which will call the increment function when the button gets clicked. When the increment function is called, it gets the current value of the count from this.state. Then it calls this.setState function with an incremented count.\nthis.setState is a special function provided by React, and it is used to change what the component is \"remembering\". It will also tell React that the old value that is still shown in the DOM is outdated and needs to be updated. This will trigger React to re-render, like we did manually with the renderCounter function.\nNow that we have refactored to use React state, we can easily add multiple counters (interactive example):\nclass App extends Component {\n    render() {\n        return (\n            \n                \n                \n                \n            \n        )\n    }\n}\n\n\nExercise:\nOpen the my-hotel React application that your created last week\n\nSet the initial state of the BookingsMessage component to have 0 bookings\nShow the number of bookings from state in BookingsMessage\nAdd an \"Add Booking\" button to the BookingsMessage component\nCreate an addBooking function on the BookingsMessage component\nAdd a click handler to the button which calls the addBooking function\nUse this.setState to increment the number of bookings in state\n\n\nFunctional Components\nSo far we have been using the class keyword to create React components. There is another way of creating components that is shorter, which are called \"functional\" components:\nfunction Greeting(props) {\n    return (\n        Hello {props.name}\n    )\n}\n\nBecause it is just a function we can make this even shorter:\nconst Greeting = (props) => Hello {props.name}\n\nIf we use some destructuring, we can make it shorter again!\nconst Greeting = ({ name }) => Hello {name}\n\nSo why don't we always use functional components? Because they can only return JSX (and inject props if there are some). Additionally they cannot hold state or have lifecycle methods (which we'll look at next week).\nIn real world applications, the things we want to remember in state follow the \"business logic\" required by our users. So for example the number of bookings in the exercise above increases when you add a booking. To help us cleanly split up code that performs business logic from code that shows the user interface we split components into \"presentational\" and \"connected\" or \"connected\" components. Often I have components that don't do anything except manage state according to the business rules and render the right \"presentational\" components.\n\"Connected\" or \"connected\" components usually have some state and handler methods. Because of this they must use the class syntax that we have been using so far. \"Presentational\" components on the other hand don't require the more verbose syntax. Instead they can use the functional syntax.\n\nExercise:\nOpen the my-hotel React application once again\n\nLook at the components we have created so far, and decide which should be converted to functional (\"presentational\") components\nConvert these components to functional components\n\n\nPassing Functions as Props\nUsually we want to change the application state when users interact with our \"presentational\" components. But as discussed above, we don't want our presentational components to have state, so how do we change state from a presentational component?\nRemember that functions in JavaScript are \"first class\" - that means we can pass a function as a variable and call it elsewhere. This includes React props (interactive example):\nclass Counter extends Component {\n    constructor(props) {\n        super(props)\n        this.state = { count: 0 }\n    }\n\n    increment = () => {\n        this.setState({ count: ++this.state.count })\n    }\n\n    render() {\n        return (\n            \n                {this.state.count}\n                \n            \n        )\n    }\n}\n\nconst FancyButton = ({ whenClicked }) => {\n    return (\n        \n            Click Me!\n        \n    )\n}\n\nWhat is happening here?\n\nThe Counter component initialises state and an increment method\nThen the Counter component passes the increment function as a prop to FancyButton\nNext the whenClicked prop (which is the increment function) is attached as a click handler in FancyButton\nWhen the button is clicked, React calls the click handler attached via onClick. Because we passed the increment function as the whenClicked prop, the increment function will be called\nThe state in Counter will be set to an incremented value\n\nThis pattern is extremely useful in separating business logic code from user interface code. It is also crucial to the concept of Lifting State Up.\nHomework\nComplete user stories 4, 5, 6, 7 from cyf-hotel-react project\nPrepare for the next class\n\nRead the lifecycle page on the official React documentation\nRead the AJAX page on the official React documentation\nWatch this video tutorial on fetching data in React\n\n"},"react/week-21/lesson.html":{"url":"react/week-21/lesson.html","title":"Week 21 - React-router & Recap","keywords":"","body":"React 3\n\nWhat will we learn today?\n\nRecap\nUnmounting\nThe Circle of Life\nFetching Data in React\nDefault Props\nRefs\n\nRecap\nLast week we looked at using props and state to create React components that change with user input (interactive example):\nclass Counter extends Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props)\n    this.state = { count: 0 }\n  }\n\n  increment = () => {\n    this.setState({ count: ++this.state.count })\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \n        Count: {this.state.count}\n        Click me!\n      \n    )\n  }\n}\n\nUnmounting\nSo far we've looked at components that are always rendered in the browser. However (and this is often the case in large applications), we might want to control whether components are shown or not. Let's look at a Toggle component (interactive example):\nconst IsShown = () => (\n  I'm shown when true ✅\n)\nconst IsNotShwon = () => (\n  I'm shown when false ☑️\n)\n\nclass Toggle extends Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props)\n    this.state = { isShown: false }\n  }\n\n  toggle = () => {\n    this.setState({ isShown: !this.state.isShown })\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \n        {this.state.isShown ?  : }\n        Toggle\n      \n    )\n  }\n}\n\nIf you open up dev tools, you will see that the element changes based on the isShown state. The hidden element is not hidden with CSS, it is actually removed from the DOM. This is important in larger applications as it can free up resources (CPU & memory) that aren't being used any more.\nThe Circle of Life\nWhen a component is within the DOM, we call it mounted. When a component is removed from the DOM, we call it unmounted. When we change state like in the unmounting example above, we can switch between these statuses. This gives us a clue that components go through a lifecycle of different statuses. We have seen 2 of the statuses: mounting and unmounting, there is also a third called updating.\nWe can hook into this lifecycle through special component methods that are added by React's Component class. They are run at different points of the lifecycle, often before and after they change to a different status. The method names are contain will or did based on whether they run before or after a status change.\nThis diagram shows the React component lifecycle:\n\nLet's look at how we can use one of the lifecycle methods (interactive example):\nclass Lifecycle extends Component {\n  componentDidMount() {\n    console.log('componentDidMount')\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return Hello World\n  }\n}\n\n\nExercise:\nOpen the my-hotel application from the last 2 weeks\n\nImplement the lifecycle hook methods in the BookingsMessage component and add a console.log to each of them. Try interacting with the component and see what order the logs appear\nThe componentWillUnmount method will never be called. Can you explain why?\nReturn false from shouldComponentUpdate in BookingsMessage. Try incrementing the number of bookings and explain what happens (change it back to return true after you are done!)\n\n\nWe'll now focus on a few of the lifecycle hooks and see how they are used.\nshouldComponentUpdate\nThis method runs when a component's props have changed, which would normally trigger a re-render. I say normally because this lifecycle hook lets us control whether the component should update (or re-render). If you want the component to render, then the method should return true. If not, then it should return false.\nWhy would we want to prevent a component from re-rendering? In some circumstances, it can be used to improve performance. If you have a component that is re-rendering a lot and it doesn't really need to, then returning false from shouldComponentUpdate is a good way to improve performance.\ncomponentDidMount and componentWillUnmount\nThe componentDidMount method runs after a component has finished rendering to the DOM. The component is now waiting for a props change or input from the user. It is called only once. We use this lifecycle hook to make changes outside of the component (sometimes these are called side effects).\nThe componentWillUnmount method runs when a component has been unmounted from the DOM. It is used to \"clean up\" the component as it is no longer being shown. Often we need to close down or cancel the changes we made in componentDidMount.\nTo look at these in more detail, we'll create a Clock component in an exercise.\n\nExercise:\nOpen the my-hotel React application from last week\n\nCreate a new Clock component and copy/paste in the code below (interactive version):\n\n\nclass Time extends Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props)\n    this.state = { date: new Date() }\n  }\n  render() {\n    return (\n      {this.state.date.toLocaleTimeString()}\n    )\n  }\n}\nclass Clock extends Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props)\n    this.state = { isShowingClock: true }\n  }\n  toggle = () => this.setState({ isShowingClock: !this.state.isShowingClock })\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \n        {this.state.isShowingClock && }\n        Toggle time\n      \n    )\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nRender the Clock component in the App component\nAdd a componentDidMount method to the Time component and use setInterval to call this.tick every second (1000 milliseconds)\nImplement the tick method, and set the date state to the current date (hint: new Date())\nAdd a console.log to the tick method. Try clicking the \"Toggle time\" button and look at what happens in the console. What do you think the problem is here? How can we fix it?\nAssign the return value of setInterval to this.timer\nIn componentWillUnmount, remove the timer by calling clearInterval(this.timer)\nTry playing around with the toggle, like in step 6. How have we solved the problem?\n\n\nFetching Data in React\nMost web applications will load data from the server. How do we do this in React? The component lifecycle is very important - we don't want to be calling our API at the wrong time, or multiple times with the same data!\nIf we tried to fetch data in our render method, it would make a request every time props or state changed. This would create lots of unnecessary requests. As we saw above, componentDidMount is called only once when the component is first rendered and so it is an ideal place for making requests. Let's look at an example:\nclass PokemonFetcher extends Component {\n  componentDidMount() {\n    fetch(`https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/${this.props.id}`)\n  }\n  render() {\n    // const name = ???\n    return Pokemon name: {name}\n  }\n}\n\nThis example isn't very useful! We can't use the data returned from the server in render because the request is asynchronous :( We need React to re-render once the request is resolved - a perfect use for state! Let's look at an example (interactive example)\nclass PokemonFetcher extends Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props)\n    this.state = { name: null }\n  }\n\n  componentDidMount() {\n    fetch(`https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/${this.props.id}`)\n      .then((res) => res.json())\n      .then((data) => {\n        this.setState({ name: data.name })\n      })\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return Pokemon name: {this.state.name}\n  }\n}\n\nNow we can see the name of the Pokemon that we fetched from the server!\nHowever we have a bit of a problem - when we first render the component, we don't have the Pokemon's name yet. We first have to initialise it to null in the constructor. This shows us that we're missing something from our UI - a loading status.\nLet's look at showing a different UI when the request is loading (interactive example):\nclass PokemonFetcher extends Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props)\n    this.state = {\n      isLoading: true,\n      name: null\n    }\n  }\n\n  componentDidMount() {\n    fetch(`https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/${this.props.id}`)\n      .then((res) => res.json())\n      .then((data) => {\n        this.setState({\n          isLoading: false,\n          name: data.name\n        })\n      })\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    if (this.state.isLoading) {\n      return Loading... &#x1F914;\n    } else {\n      return Pokemon name: {this.state.name}\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nHere are the steps that the component takes:\n\nInitialise isLoading to true\nIn render, show a loading message because isLoading is true\nOnce rendered, componentDidMount will trigger the API request\nWhen the request resolves, we set the isLoading state to false and set the data that we want\nChanging state triggers a re-render, and because isLoading is false we render out the Pokemon's name\n\nWe can still improve our component! What happens if we make a request that fails? Our request will error, but we won't show the error in the browser. Let's see how we can fix it (interactive example).\nFirst we have to deal with annoying quirk of fetch - it doesn't reject the promise on HTTP errors. We can fix this by adding another .then before we convert to JSON:\n.then((res) => {\n  if (res.status >= 200 && res.status \nNow we can add our solution - a .catch on the fetch call. Here we reset the loading state and add the error to state.\n.catch((err) => {\n  this.setState({\n    isLoading: false,\n    err: err\n  })\n})\n\nNow we can check if there's an error in state and render out an error message:\nrender() {\n  if (this.state.isLoading) {\n    return Loading... &#x1F914;\n  } else if (this.state.err) {\n    return Something went wrong &#x1F62D;\n  } else {\n    return Pokemon name: {this.state.name}\n  }\n}\n\n\nExercise:\nOpen your my-hotel application again\nConvert the SpecialDeals component to fetch data from http://www.mocky.io/v2/5a9ad31d3400002c00a39a3c.\nMake sure that you include a loading state and error handling.\n\nDefault Props\nLast week we looked at how we can pass props to our components, but so far we've had to pass a value for every prop. But React has a way of giving a \"default\" value for a prop, so that you don't always have to pass it. This makes props more useful as \"initial configuration\" for our component.\nLet's revisit an example from React week 1 with an application that says a greeting to a mentor. We could improve the app by allowing the greeting and the mentor's name to be passed as props:\nconst Greeting = (props) => {props.greeting}\nconst Mentor = (props) => {props.name}\n\nconst App = () => (\n  \n    \n    \n  \n)\n\nPassing a prop every time we want to use Greeting is a bit annoying. We want to always use \"Hello\" as our greeting, unless we explicitly override it with a prop. We can do this with defaultProps (interactive example):\nconst Greeting = (props) => {props.greeting}\nGreeting.defaultProps = {\n  greeting: 'Hello'\n}\n\nOr we can use the class/static properties syntax (interactive example):\nclass Greeting extends Component {\n  static defaultProps = {\n    greeting: 'Hello'\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return {this.props.greeting}\n  }\n}\n\nRefs\nAs we have seen, React manages the DOM for us. That means we generally don't have to worry about keeping track of DOM nodes, or manipulating them directly. However sometimes you need to be able to access a DOM node that React is managing. Some common use cases are managing browser focus and integrating with third party libraries like a jQuery plugin.\nWe can do this with a ref. Let's look at an example that will change browser focus to an input when a button is clicked (interactive example):\nclass InputFocuser extends Component {\n  setInputRef = (input) => {\n    this.input = input\n  }\n\n  focusInput = () => {\n    this.input.focus()\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \n        \n        Focus\n      \n    )\n  }\n}\n\nThe key method here is setInputRef. It is called by React when rendering the , and passes a reference to the real DOM node as an argument. We remember the reference by assigning it to this.input. Then when the button is clicked we can call the focus method (a vanilla method, not part of React) on the input DOM node.\nHomework\nComplete user stories 8, 9 and 10 from cyf-hotel-react project\n"},"others/coding-101.html":{"url":"others/coding-101.html","title":"Coding 101","keywords":"","body":"Coding 101\n\nWhat we will learn today?\n\nWhat is a computer program?\nGetting started with JavaScript\n\nWhat is a computer program\n\nIntro to programming logic – Making a sandwich (Source:\nhttp://static.zerorobotics.mit.edu/docs/team-activities/ProgrammingPeanutButterAndJelly.pdf)\n\n\nAsk the students what they think a program is at its most basic level\nGuide, if necessary, towards the idea that its instructions or an action\netc.\n\n\nFocus on the idea of instructions:\nExplain that like with a physical activity - tools and steps are required\nto carry out instructions\nIntroduce the group activity of programming the activity of making a\nsandwich\n\n\nAsk the students what items we will need to make a sandwich:\nAs they shout them out list them on the screen for the whole class to see\nIntroduce the concept of objects and classes. Tie into the idea of how in a\nprogram these would be the 'tools' required for an activity and how for our\nsandwich making task the items we have listed previously are our classes\n\n\nNow that we have all of the tools we need to make a sandwich ask the students\nto shout out what they think the first step or instruction is:\nWrite the instruction out on the screen and ask the students which object\nwould be needed to carry out that instruction\nCopy the instruction and place it under the object that the students have\ndecided is responsible for it and introduce the idea of methods\nContinue asking the students for instructions and listing them under the\nobjects that would be responsible for them (in the case where two objects\nare required to carry out an instruction try and break it down further with\nthe students until only one object is responsible for any one instruction –\ncould be a good way to introduce the idea of how specific you need to be in\nprogramming and the concepts that are detailed in the source example of\nthis exercise)\n\n\nOnce the students are satisfied with the instructions take the best formed\nclass and ask the students to come up with a one word summary for each\ninstruction that is has. Explain the benefits of well named methods in\nprogramming and (maybe?) touch on naming conventions.\n\nGetting started with JavaScript\nWe will spend most of this lesson in Codepen. To get started, go to\nhttps://codepen.io/pen to create a new Pen. On the bottom left,\nclick the \"Console\" button to open the console.\n\nYou can place your cursor right behind the > sign. Type a simple expression,\nsuch as 2 + 2 and hit enter. You will see expression, as well as its result,\nin the window above.\n\nYou will be able to follow most of this session along just entering expressions\nin the console like this.\nVariables and assignments\nFor an expression or a value to be of any use to us, we need to store it in a\nvariable.\nVariables have a name (identifier) that we can use to refer to a value. You\ncan assign a value to a variable with the following statement:\nvar x = 3;\n^   ^ ^ ^\n|   | | value\n|   | assignment operator\n|   identifier\ndeclaration statement\n\nLet's break this statement down:\n\nvar: With the var statement we tell the JavaScript engine that x is now\na variable\nx: The variable name/identifier. It can be short or long, but must not\ncontain spaces and must not start with a number.\n=: The equal sign is the assigmnent operator\n3: The value that we assign to the variable. This can be any number, string\nor boolean, or any more complex data type that we will introduce later. You\ncan also use an existing variable here.\n;: THe semicolon is not strictly needed, but is generally used to terminate\na statement.\n\nNow you can use the identifier instead of the actual value in an expression:\nx + x, x * x, console.log(x)\nSimple data types & Expressions\nNumbers\nLet's start with something seemingly simple - numbers. Here are some:\n1;\n15;\n3195803798;\n1.4;\n0.0000005;\n0 - 23;\n\nYou will see that there are whole numbers (no decimal point) and real numbers\n(decimal point), which in JavaScript are so-called “floating point” numbers.\nNumbers can be positive or negative and they support all the basic math\noperators that you would expect:\n2 + 2; // 4\n2 - 5; // -3\n2 * 3; // 6\n10 / 2; // 5\n3 * -2; // -6\n\nOperators have the same precedence as in algebra: * and / have higher\nprecedence than + and -.\n\nTODO: Do math exercise\nTODO: What about Infinity, Math.PI, IEEE floating point bullshit, NaN\n\nStrings\nStrings represent any sort of text. They are delimited by single quotes (') or\ndouble quotes (”) and can be of any length.\n'' // empty string\n\"\" // empty string\n'Hello'\n'I am learning JavaScript'\n'It\\'s been a great journey so far!'\n\"Double quotes work as well\"\n\n\nIf you need single or double quotes inside the string, you need to “escape”\nthem by putting a backslash in front of them. If you don't do this, the\nJavaScript engine will think the string ends here, because it encounters a\nquote.\n\nThe most common operation on strings is to append one string to another. This is\ncalled string concatenation. It's achieved by the plus (+) operator:\n\"Hello\" + \"World\" // \"HelloWorld\"\n\n\nTODO: Introduce string concatenation\nTODO: What about basic string functions, like substr, replace etc?\n\nBooleans\nBooleans are a data type that\ncan only have two values: true and false.\nLike numbers, they can be combined using operators, but there are different\noperators for booleans (analoguous to\nBoolean algebra). The most\nimportant ones are:\n\n! (NOT), which negates a value:\n\n!true; // false\n!false; // true\n\n\n&& (AND), which is only true if both operands are true:\n\nfalse && false; // false\ntrue && false; // false\nfalse && true; // false\ntrue && true; // true\n\n\n|| (OR), which is true if at least one of the operands is true:\n\nfalse && false; // false\ntrue && false; // true\nfalse && true; // true\ntrue && true; // true\n\nTODO: When to introduce truthiness and falsiness? Probably in comparisons?\n\n\nExercise: Put simple mathematical expressions into the console: 2 * 2,\n2 + 2, 5 * 7 - 13 > Exercise: Calculate the area of a circle (r * r *\npi). Do a quick Google search on how to use PI in JavaScript.\nSee what happens when you \"add\" two strings together\nResearch the JS Math library. sqrt, floor, ceil, round\nWrite an expression that outputs the percentage of students who are female.\nMake it so it outputs it as 58%, and make sure you use the actual numbers of\nwomen and the total number of students. Solution: console.log(Math.round(7 /\n17 * 100) + \"%\");\n\nFrom REPL to console.log\n\nSingle expressions are not very useful, you want to write applications\nMore than one statement? Move it to the JS box in Codepen\nNow you don't get any immediate feedback\nUse console.log to print to the console: console.log(3 + 3);\nWrite statements below each other\n\n\nTHOUGHT: Codepen does not have a \"run\" button, so it's quite intransparent\nwhen it actually re-runs a program. Maybe a different tool is better? A simple\njsbin configuration, maybe?\n\n"},"html-css/compile-scss-instructions.html":{"url":"html-css/compile-scss-instructions.html","title":"Compiling SCSS","keywords":"","body":"Building SCSS with VS Code\n\nCreate a file with a .scss extension.

Where is our new database? ???\n\nLazy initialisation.\n\nDatabases\nCollections and Documents\nCollections are like tables in SQL databases.\nInitialising a collection is also happening lazily like this:\n> db.Student.insert({name: 'alex'})\nNow if we run again show dbs after we create a collection with a document\nwe will see that the database appears in the list.\nThis is because at the moment that we inserted this document,\nthe document was created, which in turn created the collection\nwhich in turn created the database.\nExercise 1\nInsert a new student with name: Mary\nExercise 2\nInsert a new student with name: Madeline and id=2 (integer)\nExercise 3\nInsert a new student with name: Steve, midterm score of 80 and final score of 100\nScores should be embedded in a sub-document like this:\nscores:\n{\n  midterm: 0,\n  final: 0\n}\n\nFinding Documents\nFinding a document by a single attribute:\n> db.Student.find({name: 'alex'})\n\nQuerying embedded attributes:\n> db.Student.find({\"scores.midterm\": {$gte: 40}} )\n\nAND / OR queries:\n> db.Student.find({\"$or\": [{\"scores.midterm\": {$gt: 60}}, {\"scores.final\": {$lte: 75}}]} )\n\nExercise 4a\nFind the user Mary that you inserted in exercise 1\nExercise 4b\nSearch for students that have scored between [50,80)\nin midterm AND [80,100] in final exam\nIn these two examples above we can see the operators\nGreaterThanEquals >=, GreaterThan > and LessThanEquals \nAll operators in MongoDB:\nhttps://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/query/\nUpdating Documents\nUpdating documents has 2 parts.\nThe first one is finding the document(s) we want to update\nand the second one is modifying their values.\n(!)\ndb.Student.update({name: 'alex'}, {name: 'alexander'})\n\nWhat will this command do?\nREPLACE the first instance of document matching {name:'alex'}\nwith the new {name:'alexander'} !!!!\nDefinitely not what we want...\n> db.Student.update({name: 'alex'}, {$set: {name: 'alexander'}})\n\nWe can also use other operators like $inc, $mul, $min, $max\nhttps://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/update/#fields\n(!)

This is vertical scaling.\nIt's of course the easiest way to scale\nbut does not scale linearly in terms of cost and capacity.\nDistribute our data across different servers of the same initial capacity.\nThis is called horizontal scaling, is more difficult to achieve\nbut theoretically if we achieve linear scaling\nthen our system can be infinitely scaleable.\n\nWith MongoDB it's important to understand that we will start with #1\nfor as long as it makes financial sense.\nIf we are on AWS it will probably be easier to tweak our replica set\nfrom S to M to L sized servers rether than implement sharding.\nAt some point though, we should start planning for sharding,\ndefinitely sooner rather than later.\n\nSharding as we can see from the diagram above is not a trivial task.\nWe need router(s) config servers and shards.\nRouter:\nThe router is essentially our query server.\nQueries no longer go to individual servers\nbut must go to the router which will decide which server(s) hold our data.\nConfig Servers:\nConfig servers are holding configuration information for the whole cluster.\nThey must be deployed as a replica set in order to achieve high availability.\nShards:\nEach shard is essentially a replica set.\nEach shard holds a cut of our data\nand all the shards together hold the total of our data.\nMore information:\nhttps://docs.mongodb.com/manual/sharding/\nWhat's next\nIf you have time and interest,\nplease register to this class or any other class in MongoDB university.\nAll classes are free and on average require 6-10 hours of time per week.\nhttps://university.mongodb.com/courses/M001/about\nShameless plug\nI am also the author of the Mastering MongoDB 3.X book by Packt publishing,\navailable here.\n"},"others/aws-workshop-2.html":{"url":"others/aws-workshop-2.html","title":"AWS - DynamoDB","keywords":"","body":"Node 4\n\nWhat we will learn today?\n\nDatabases overview\nMongoDB\nMongo Shell\nMongo with Node\n\n\nBefore we start\nDownload and install MongoDb from https://www.mongodb.com/download-center#community.\nFollow the instructions for your platform (Windows, Linux or OS X).\nAlso download and install RoboMongo from https://robomongo.org/download.\nOpen two instances of terminal.\nRun mongod—this will start MongoDB then run mongo on the other window.\n\nIn the mongo shell (terminal), run the command version() and you should get\nthe version of Mongo printed on the terminal\nDatabases overview\n\nDiscussion:\n\nWhat is a database role?\nWhy do we need a database? Why not just use the file system?\nWhat would make a good database?\n\n\nWhy a database\n\nDatabases can store very large numbers of records efficiently (they take up\nlittle space).\nYou can have strucutre on your data\nYou can query for data in a database, you can sort data, add/edit/delete data\nYou can optimise a database to make searches (queries) quicker\nYou can relate pieces of data to each other to avoid duplication which makes\nyour information more reliable and less prone to errors\nACID\nIn computer science, ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) is\na set of properties of database transactions intended to guarantee validity\neven in the event of errors, power failures, etc.\n\n\nDatabases can handle very large data sets.\nDatabases are concurrent; multiple users can use them at the same time without\ncorrupting the data.\nDatabases scale well\n\nRelational and non-relational databases\nThere are mainly two flavours of databases used commercially these days.\nRelational (SQL) and non-relational (NoSQL) databases.\nRelational databases include MySQL, Postgres, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle\nDatabase and many others. They've been around for a long time and they're used\nfor all kind of applications.\nNon-relational databases are relatively new and they include the likes of\nMongoDB, Casandra, Neo4j etc...\nMongo\n\nMongoDB is a free and open-source cross-platform document-oriented database\nprogram. Classified as a NoSQL database program, MongoDB uses JSON-like\ndocuments.\n\nBSON (JSON-like document)\nIn a Relational database, information is organised in rows in tables with\npredefined columns.\nIn a non-relational database, information is organised in documents. MongoDB\nstores data records in a format similar to JSON called BSON. BSON is a binary\nrepresentation of JSON documents, though it contains more data types than JSON.\n\nLet's look at this database table Students containing information about\nstudents participating in a course \n\nExercise: What are the columns, rows and tables?\n\n\n\nExercise: Open https://jsonlint.com/ and write a JSON representation of two\nrows in the Students table example. Click Validate JSON and make sure the\ndocument is valid.\n\nAre there any alternative representations you can think of?\n\n\nBSON is very similar to JSON. It contains more data types than JSON, it also\nallows the field names to not be quoted. Read more information about the\nformat: https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/document/.\nMongo Shell\nLet's go to mongo shell and start interacting with our database system.\n1. Create a database\nOn the shell, type the command use profile The shell should respond with\nswitched to db profile. At this stage, the database does not necessarily\nexist once we start adding information (collections) then the database will be\ncreated and the collection added to them.\nTo check the current database, run db.\n2. Create a collection\nNow let's create our first collection. Make sure you're using the profile\ndatabase. Run db and it should print profile on the terminal.\nWe will insert a simple document representing a student.\n\ndb.students.insertOne({ name: 'Habiiba', country: 'Somalia', assignedMentors:\n['Ashleigh'] })\n\nYou should get a confirmation with the number of records inserted.\nYou can also insert more than one document at a time. Run this command\n\ndb.students.insertMany([{ name: 'Khalid', country: 'Yemen' }, { name:\n'Yohannes', country: 'Ethiopia', assignedMentors: ['Michael'] }])\n\nrun the command db.students.count() and you should get that you have 3\ndocuments.\n3. Querying data\nQuerying is one of the most important reasons that we use databases. SQL is the\nlanguage used for querying relational databases, In MongoDB, we can use the\nmethod db.collection.find, passing a query in the form of a JSON object as a\nfirst parameter.\nLet's try few queries:\nGet all the students from Ethiopia.\n\ndb.students.find({country: 'Ethiopia'})\n\nWe can also provide an extra parameter projection to define what fields we\nwant back from the query.\nFor example, if we're only interested in the name\ndb.students.find({ country: \"Ethiopia\" }, { name: 1 });\n// you can also use { name: true }\n\nLet's add another two students to the collection\ndb.students.insertOne({ name: 'Mohamed', country: 'Sudan', assignedMentors:\n['Michael'] })\nand\ndb.students.insertOne({ name: 'Mohamed', country: 'Syria', assignedMentors:\n['Michael', 'Ashleigh'] })\nNow let's query for all the students that have Michael as mentor.\ndb.students.find({ assignedMentors: [\"Michael\"] });\n\nWhat if we want to find any student whose name is \"Mohamed\" AND whose country is\n\"Sudan\". You can then use the logical query operator $and.\ndb.students.find({\n  $and: [{ name: \"Mohamed\" }, { country: \"Sudan\" }]\n});\n\nNotice that name and country are case-sensitive.\nExercise\n\nFind all students for whom Ashleigh is an assigned mentor.\nFind all students that have Michael as their only mentor\nFind students whose name is Mohamed OR Michael is their only mentor\nRead about the\n$in operator\nand use it to find students whose country is either Sudan or Ethiopia.\nLook at the other\nComparison Query Operators\nand the\nLogical Query Operators\nand use few of them.\n\nKey Concepts so far\nIn Mongo, a database contains collections that contain BSON\ndocuments. We can use the mongo shell to interact with our Mongo\ndatabases. The query documents are used to specify a selection filter using\nquery operators\nto search for documents in the collections.\n\nCheckpoint: Do you understand all the words highlighed in the last paragraph?\n\nNode with Mongo\nSo far we've been connecting to Mongo using the Mongo shell. Mongo has drivers\nfor most major programming languages but it's especially popular with NodeJS\napplications as its API and Query model is very close to JavaScript syntax and\npatterns.\nLet's start wiring Node with MongoDB as a datastore.\n\nFork and Clone the project\nhttps://github.com/CodeYourFuture/mongo-node-workshop.\nrun npm install then npm run dev to run the application with autoreload -\nGo to the browser and make sure it's up and running.\n\nInstall the MongoDB Node.js Driver npm install mongodb --save\n\nLet's add an endpoint api/students that returns a json containing all the\nstudents that we've been saving to the database from the shell.\n\n\nGo to the file controllers/apiController, on top of the file, require the\nmodule\nconst MongoClient = require(\"mongodb\").MongoClient;\n\nthen add an endpoint for /students\nrouter.get(\"/students\", (req, res) => {\n  const mongoConnection = \"mongodb://localhost:27017/profile\";\n\n  MongoClient.connect(mongoConnection, (err, db) => {\n    const cursor = db.collection(\"students\").find({});\n    cursor.toArray((error, students) => {\n      db.close();\n      res.json(students);\n    });\n  });\n});\n\nGo to your browser /api/students and you should see a JSON containing the\ndocuments we've added to the students collection earlier.\n\nExercise: Let's step through the previous code and understand it line by line.\n\nWhat is a Mongo conection string?\n\n\nThe connection string\nfollows this format:\nmongodb://[username:password@]host1[:port1][,host2[:port2],...[,hostN[:portN]]][/[database][?options]].\nWhat parts do you have in our connection string right now?\nExercise part 1\nNow let's change the api/posts to also use the mongo database instead of the\njson file under /data.\n\nFirst step is to save the posts in the database. Similar to what we did\nwith students collection, use the Mongo shell to create a new collection\ncalled posts and use insertMany to insert all the documents.\n\nChange the endpoint /api/posts to read its contents from the database (very\nsimilar code to what we wrote in /api/students endpoint). Go to\nhttp://localhost:3000/api/posts and make sure you see the posts. Update a\ndocument in the database (either check the documentation for\nupdate\nor use RoboMongo) and see if it gets reflected.\n\nOnce you have the endpoint running, delete the json data/posts.json.\n\nNow if you go to the root of your application http://localhost:3000, you\nwill encounter an error as it will still try to read from the file system but\nwe deleted the file. Update the / endpoint to also get the Posts from the\ndatabase.\n\n\nExercise part 2: refactor the code\nEven though our code does what's supposed to do, it has several issues. We have\na lot of duplicate code—both endpoints GET /api/posts and GET / do the\nsame call to the database and then do something with it. It's only that\nsomething (the callback) that is different so let's refactor the code to\neliminate duplication (DRY).\n\nThe variable mongoConnection is declared multiple times, that means that if\nthe connection string changes then we need to change multiple places causing\npossibilities of missing one instance and causing errors. Let's declare it\nonce and use it in the rest of the app.\n\nWhy is it bad to have duplicate code?\n\n\nExtract the Mongo calls to seperate functions. Extract the route for\n/api/students into a function named getStudents\n\nWhat will the function signature be?\nRemember the Single Responsibility Principle—the route handlers have\nmultiple responsibilities right now: Connecting to Mongo, getting the data\nthen sending it back as a response.\n\n\nMove the new function to a new file called helpers/db-client.js, export the\nfunctions and use them in the original file.\n\nDo you remember how we create modules and use them? module.exports and\nrequire.\n\n\nDo the same for the /posts\n\n\nExercise Part 3: Deploy our app\nLet's deploy our Database-Driven Application to Heroku. If you don't remember\nthe steps, refresh your memory from\nthe previous lesson.\nOnce you're finsihed, Go to your application on heroku and see if it is working\nproperly.\nIt should not be working.\nCan you have a guess on what went wrong? To see what's happening on the heroku\nserver, run heroku logs from the terminal and check the logs.\nMongo on Heroku\nHeroku, AWS and other cloud services allows us to use databases and other\nservices on the cloud without having to maintain physical servers making it easy\nto scale, monitor costs and build good solutions in general.\nWe've already used DynamoDB on AWS. This week, we'll do MongoDB.\n\nGo to Heroku dashboard\nhttps://dashboard.heroku.com\n\nClick on your app name in the dashboard. Go to Resources, under addons,\nsearch for mLab MongoDB and choose it. When you're prompted with this\nscreen—click on Provision.\n\nThe new MongoDB service will appear under Resources-you can click on it and it\nwill take you to a web interface to administer your MongoDB instance.\n\nGo to the Settings and click on Reveal Config Vars. You should see the\na variable called MongoDB_URI—that is the connection string for the MongoDB\ninstance on Heroku (on mLab used by Heroku).\n\nSo how can we use this connection string instead of our local one?\n\n\n\nEnvironment variables\nIn NodeJS, The process.env property returns an object containing the user\nenvironment. Environment variables allow us to configure different aspects of\nour application based on the environment where it's running—so for instance,\nwhen we run our application locally, we want to connect to the local MongoDB but\non Heroku, we want to connect to a different one.\nConnection strings are typically saved and used as Environment variables, other\ntypical uses are with passwords, secrets, URLs of other services etc... Anything\nthat is environment specific and that shouldn't live in the source code.\n\nSecurity tip: Never add passwords, connection strings or any sensitive\ninformation in your source code, always use an Environment variable.\n\nServices like Heroku and AWS can then use these environment variables to\nconfigure aspects of the application.\n\nWe've already used one Environment variable for Heroku before—what was it?\nExercise: Use the environment MongoDB_URI to connect to MongoDB on Heroku,\nbut fallback to localhost connection string if there is no environment\nvariable provided.\n\n\nCommit and push the changes to Heroku and see if it works.\n\nHomework\nRefer to the MongoDB/Node workshop for the Homework tasks -\nhttps://github.com/CodeYourFuture/mongo-node-workshop\n\nRead https://www.upguard.com/articles/mysql-vs-mongodb\n\nResources\n\nWhy use a database:\nhttps://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/190482/why-use-a-database-instead-of-just-saving-your-data-to-disk\nDatabases and Collections:\nhttps://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/databases-and-collections/\nDocuments in MongoDB:\nhttps://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/document/\nPractice on a web Mongo shell:\nhttps://www.tutorialspoint.com/mongodb_terminal_online.php\nEnvironment Variables:\nhttps://www.twilio.com/blog/2017/08/working-with-environment-variables-in-node-js.html\nMongoDB SQL comparison:\nhttps://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/sql-comparison/\n\n"},"others/java.html":{"url":"others/java.html","title":"Java module","keywords":"","body":"Java\nCodeYourFuture does not officially teach Java, however, if you wish to learn\nJava you can follow this\nJava syllabus\n"},"others/coding-standards.html":{"url":"others/coding-standards.html","title":"Coding Standards and Best Practices","keywords":"","body":"Coding Standards and Best Practices\nGeneral\n\nIndentation should be consistent\n\nI.e. all files should use either tabs or spaces and the same width (e.g. 4\ncharacters)\nDo not mix tabs and spaces\n\n\nUse one casing style\n\nUsually:\ncamelCase for JavaScript\nhyphen-case or camelCase for CSS\n\n\nDo not mix casing styles e.g. let first_name = person.firstName;\n\n\nTest coverage should be sufficient\n\nThis should meet or exceed the configured threshold; if this isn't possible,\nexplain why\n\n\nComment code that might be difficult to understand...\n...but also consider simplifying complex code if at all possible.

(Nothing turns off a recruiter faster if the first line of the CV says you are something they are not looking for!) Mirror the job ad language here – if they call a developer a designer, use their language. \nNext – if the ad asks for certain tools, and you have that experience – mention them in the profile. Bring out the most relevant bits of your CV experience in the next couple of sentences.\nFinally – the last sentence is what you want to do next. What sort of role in what sort of organisation. Again, mirror the language of the job ad. If they say they are a young dynamic agency – then you would like your next role in a young dynamic organisation. \nMirroring the language and terms helps you apply for a particular role. If you are writing a general CV, write it using industry standard terms and tools. \nCareer section explained\nEverything you have delivered in a role can be explained as an achievement. Each achievement is just an example of completed work – ideally one that went well. It needs to have some quantitative element if possible.  Each job needs 2 – 3 achievements. Layout something like:\nJan 2018 – Sept 2019    Front End Web Developer            Acme Web Ltd\nAcme are an award winning developer based in Glasgow, with a design team of 30, and clients across the UK. Working as part of a wide team, and along-side clients, I develop unique web front ends with UI and mobile accessibility in mind. Working with Jira, PHP and Adobe tools.\nAchievements:\n- 2018 - Redesigned and dramatically simplified a web site for a client in 2 months, with very positive feedback from the client and their customers. \n- 2019 - Working on a client premise, alongside marketing team, Created a custom Wordpress site for a charity, retiring an aging flash site. Handover included posting and maintenance training and documentation allowing them to become self-sufficient.\nAchievements stop you writing in broad terms about your responsibilities and give a better flavour of your experience.\nAdd the most recent experience first. The most recent/ most important information appears ahead of the older or less important. If education is more important than experience, then put the education section ahead of experience. In most cases, experience is going to be of more interest. Focus on the experience that is relevant to the job you want. If have an older unrelated career, defocus its importance to you by writing less about it. Pull out the important aspects that are transferable though. For example if your previous experience was working in a pub only write 1 line about it, with no achievements. – there are transferable skills – customer service, working as part of a team, supporting colleagues.\nJan 2016 – Jan 2018    The Royal Hotel             Barman\nFlexibly working whist studying  - Part of a small team in a busy hotel bar – working nights/weekends \n(move on, next job - recruiters don’t want any more info)\nDon’t try to hide gaps in employment. Explain them if more than a few months. Having said that, if you have unpaid volunteer work – add this as a job. Expand on it if it provided relevant experience. \nCV Layout\nThe layout of the CV should be right for the role you’re applying for – an accountant’s cv should be boring (would you hire a creative accountant?). A creative’s cv can be more visually appealing – but it’s tricky to get right. Like all things, for your CV, content is king – layout and eye-appeal is secondary – and in many cases, if done badly can detract from the content.\n2-column CVs are best avoided. But some are worse than others.\n\nIn this 2-column example, 2-column format is applied to all of CV text so that the top of both columns is likely to be very different content – this makes it more difficult to read and can trip up screen reading and applicant tracking systems (ATSs) if it tries to read across a line. \nAlso – CVs are usually compiled with the most important information at the top of page 1, and the least important at the top of page 2. The 2-col format can distort this – leaving your best information at the bottom of the page.\n\nOne 2-column format that can work is using a 2nd ‘minor’ column for keywords and skills – to highlight the experience in the main body. It can be a lot of work to set this up and it still can trick an ATS in to trying to parse it as a single line. \nIf you absolutely have to have a 2-column format – this is going to be the best.\nBottom line - avoid the 2 columns, it doesn’t gain you enough for the problems it causes.\nFile format\nAvoid PDF if you can. PDFs can be tricky to copy and paste from - often adding line breaks to text blocks that line-wrap.  (Agencies often reformat your CV to fit their house style in order to present it to clients – making copy & paste more difficult will not help them).\nDOC or DOCX / Word format is preferred by most employers and agents. It's easy to manipulate and copy into systems, and still the ‘industry standard’ CV format. Never embed macros into the doc – most email virus systems will filter these by default.\nRTF (rich text) – this is still popular, and if you can make it look good in RTF it is light and easy to maintain. \nWhatever the format - never more than 15mb file size. Keep graphical elements to a minimum.\nCV guides\n\nhttps://nationalcareers.service.gov.uk/get-a-job/cv-sections\nhttp://www.energizerecruitment.co.uk/software-developers-guide-writing-cv-2017/\n\nCV samples\n\nhttps://www.livecareer.co.uk/cv-search/r/front-end-web-developer-31839afbd6b640429d637cdda953561c\nhttps://www.livecareer.co.uk/cv-search/r/front-end-developer-00fdd3a63d27437d899f94a70df420be\nhttps://www.brookes.ac.uk/students/careers/students-and-graduates/cv-guide/mature-graduate-cv/\n— useful reference for people with gaps in their CV\n\nCover letter\nA cover letter is essential for job applications.\nEnsure you provide one for each of your job applications.\nYou can search the internet to find various cover letter guides and samples.\nInterviews\nGeneral interview questions\n\nhttps://www.wisebread.com/how-to-answer-23-of-the-most-common-interview-questions\n\nTechnical interview questions with answers (intermediate-level)\n\nhttps://github.com/30-seconds/30-seconds-of-interviews\nhttps://github.com/FAQGURU/FAQGURU\n\nQuestions to ask the company\n\nhttps://github.com/Twipped/InterviewThis\n— some of these questions are great, but some are not so good\n\nLive interview practice\n\nhttps://www.pramp.com/\n\nPersonal projects\nPersonal projects are a good way to build up your portfolio of code projects on Github.\nThey are very useful for employers to see how you code\nand also demonstrate your enthusiasm.\nInspiration for personal projects\n\nhttps://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas\nhttps://github.com/karan/Projects\n\nWalkthroughs of projects\n\nhttps://github.com/tuvtran/project-based-learning\nhttps://javascript30.com/\n\nContributing to open source\nEasier open source issues for people starting with open source contribution\n\nhttps://github.com/MunGell/awesome-for-beginners\nhttps://firstcontributions.github.io/\n\nHow to contribute to an open source project on GitHub\n\nhttps://egghead.io/courses/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github\n\nOther\n\nTips for creating your own portfolio website\nCareer tips from HackYourFuture, a refugee code school in Amsterdam\n\n"},"others/developer-links.html":{"url":"others/developer-links.html","title":"Developer Links","keywords":"","body":"Developer Links\nThis page aims to give you the best links for working as a developer\nand improving your skills.\n\nThis developer roadmap\ngives a very good overview of what a senior developer should know or be aware\nof in the modern front-end, back-end or devops world.

expression,\nnon-binary gender, etc), sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance,\nbody size, race, religion, and programming background.\nWe do not tolerate harassment of community participants in any form,\nand sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any community activity.\nHarassment\nHarassment is a form of discrimination in the UK under the Equality Act 2010.\nDiscrimination which is against the Equality Act is unlawful.\nThis means action can be taken against you in the civil courts.\nHarassment may be verbal, non-verbal, or physical.\nExamples of unwanted conduct are:\n\nVerbal comments that reinforce social structures of domination related to\ngender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability,\nphysical appearance, body size, race, age, religion\nOffensive and suggestive remarks (including via emails, messages and other\nelectronic communications, posters, objects, written materials or graffiti)\nIntimate questions\nFoul or obscene language\nInnuendo and derogatory comments\nJokes, banter, teasing, nicknames, ridicule or insults\nInappropriate comments about dress, appearance, physique or abilities\nPersistent requests for social activities\n(after it has been made clear that such requests are unwelcome)\nor other persistent unwelcome attention of a personal nature\nWhistling, winking or suggestive or offensive gestures\nDeliberate ignoring or isolation of a community member\nInappropriate physical contact\n(including touching, standing too close, pinching, pushing and grabbing)\nSustained disruption of talks, working groups or other events\nUnwelcome sexual attention or suggestive behaviour\n(which the harasser may perceive as harmless)\nThreats, assault or coercing sexual acts\nRacist, sexist, homophobic or ageist jokes, or derogatory or\nstereotypical remarks about a particular ethnic or religious group or gender\nMocking, mimicking or belittling a person's disability\nSexual images in public spaces\nDeliberate intimidation, stalking, or following\nHarassing photography or recording\nAdvocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behaviour\n\nA person may also be harassed even if they were not the intended target.\nFor example, a person may be harassed by racist jokes about a different\nethnic group if the jokes create an offensive environment.\nOur position is that no harassment of any kind should take place\nand all community members have a responsibility to ensure at all times\nthat their own behaviour does not offend others.\nThe Equality Act defines harassment as where behaviour is meant to\nor has the effect of either violating dignity or creating an\nintimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment.\nThis means it is harassment even if the harasser did not mean to offend\nor intimidate, as long as the harassment has one of the above effects.\nBullying\nBullying is any behaviour or action (whether physical, verbal or non-verbal)\nthat is offensive, intimidating, malicious or insulting intended to undermine,\nhumiliate, denigrate or injure the recipient.\nIt also includes an abuse or misuse of power,\ndeliberately setting an individual up to fail and unjustified intimidation.\nIn addition to the examples listed for harassment above,\nbullying may also include but is not limited to:\n\nShouting in public\nPersistent or unfair criticism\nOstracising people\nPhysical or psychological threats and instilling fear\nSpreading malicious rumours\nConstantly undervaluing effort/achievement\nWithholding information\n\nResponsibilities\nCommunity members have a responsibility to behave in a way that is not\noffensive to others and to acknowledge that views and opinions held\nby others may not always coincide with their own.\nReporting\nIf you are being harassed or bullied or notice that this is happening\nto someone else, or have any other concerns, please let a mentor know.\nWe will help take appropriate actions to stop this behaviour,\nand will not take any actions without your agreement and consent.\nIf you would prefer to report anonymously,\nplease use this form\nEnforcement\nCommunity members are asked to stop any harassing behaviour\nand perpetrators are expected to comply immediately.\nWe retain the right to take any actions to keep the community\na welcoming environment for all participants.\nThis includes warning the offender or exclusion from the program\nif the situation does not improve.\n"},"CONTRIBUTING.html":{"url":"CONTRIBUTING.html","title":"Contributing","keywords":"","body":"Contributing\nBefore starting, please read the following general guidelines and\nchecklist for
